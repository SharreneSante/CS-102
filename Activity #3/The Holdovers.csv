"The Holdovers","aharmas","29 October 2023",1010,"Here is a film that feels and looks like something out of the early seventies. The Holdovers is a strong and warm-hearted piece that gives actors roles with powerful lines, without any reliance on flashy editing and being overwhelmed by special effects.The story is simple three people get stuck for the Christmas holidays in a boarding school. It's cold, lonely, and boring for the parties involved. The adults drink to cope with whatever pressures they live with. The young man resorts to bad behavior and altercations with the teacher in charge.Through the vacation period these people will get to interact and get to know each other, something that will prove to a challenge to say the least. As the story evolves, we get to understand what has made the people who they are. We get to feel their pain and frustration through the very insightful writing of the director.It's a strong film with superb acting by the main leads. They have great chemistry together.Most outstanding is Paul Giamatti who plays the tormented and defensive man with relish and speaks volumes with his eyes.Hope the academy honors his performance as the best the year because no one else so far is coming close."
"The Holdovers","darkreignn","29 October 2023",910,"Let's just get this out of the way now - when it comes to writing this review, I'm probably a little bit biased (and a little bit drunk, currently, but that's besides the point). You see, I have an affinity for indie coming of age movies, and ""The Holdovers"" is basically an indie coming of age film, so it may - or may not - come as a surprise to you that I absolutely adored this picture. So, with that little preface out of the way, it's time for me to gush over this movie.Starring none other than Paul Giamatti as Paul Hunham, Giamatti plays a professor at an all boys boarding school where, over Christmas break, he has the misfortune of looking over a group of boys, one of whom is named Angus, played by Dominic Sessa. After a rocky start, where Paul clearly doesn't get along with any of the boys, making his disdain clear and evident, he eventually finds himself alone with Angus - as well as with the school's cook, Mary Lamb, played by Da'Vine Joy Randolph - in an unexpected chain of events. What occurs after is a slice-of-life style piece of cinema that allows broken people to find comfort in each other's company.""The Holdovers"" is, without a doubt, one of my favorite movies of 2023, as well as probably one of the best movies of the year, as well. This Christmas-themed gem doesn't hold back on the drama, delivering a thoughtful blend of comedy, coming-of-age storytelling, and a touch of romance - all wrapped around a very raw, human plot-line that virtually everyone can relate to. I'm no spring chicken myself, but I found myself deeply connected to both main characters - one who is older and basically dejected with life as he knows it, and one who is younger but who feels lost, aimless, and disconnected from both family and friends. And admittedly, not everyone will have a direct parallel to these experiences, but even if you don't, you're in for a story that's bound to tug at your heartstrings... and make you laugh out loud in the process.This is a high-quality movie - from the impeccable acting to the beautiful on-location cinematography to the relatable, thought-provoking plot, every element is executed with pinpoint precision and finesse; it's a testament to the art of storytelling on the silver screen. Director Alexander Payne knows how to create an artful film, and ""The Holdovers"" is no exception. It's at once indie and art-house while simultaneously being mainstream and easily accessible; in short, it's a film for everyone that actually feels like a genuine crowdpleaser instead of a pandering mess.I'm having a difficult time describing what I liked about this movie, and the reason is because I liked almost everything about this movie. So why the 9 out of 10 rating instead of the perfect 10? Literally the only thing that's holding me back is because I would've liked a touch more romance; yes, there was romance here, but a bit more would've pushed me over the edge into 10 out of 10 territory. Besides that, this is basically a perfect film, one that I loved, and one that has become one of my favorite movies of the year, if not of all time. I am genuinely looking forward to rewatching this, and I can't wait until it becomes closer to Christmas so I can view this on my own TV, cuddled under blankets, with a glass of whiskey, and bask in the absolute heartwarming experience that is ""The Holdovers."" My recommendation: Do yourself a favor and watch this as soon as you can - you won't regret it."
"The Holdovers","evanston_dad","20 November 2023",1010,"Mid-way through ""The Holdovers,"" I started openly weeping in the movie theater, and I pretty much kept it up on and off for the rest of the movie. Sometimes, there wasn't even anything obviously sad or moving happening in the scene, and I still couldn't stop. I think it's because this movie is so kind, and kindness is a rare commodity these days. It's sad to think that a movie about characters learning to have compassion for each other and for the hardships they've been through should feel like such a rare beast, but here we are.This is Alexander Payne firing on all cylinders as a director, and though he didn't write this movie, it feels like he could have. It's an obvious throwback to the kinds of movies Hal Ashby made throughout the 1970s and is touching in exactly the same way ""Harold and Maude"" was. It's also a master class in acting from the three principal characters played by Paul Giamatti, Dominic Sessa, and Da 'Vine Joy Randolph, and I hope all three of them, and the movie overall, is remembered come Oscar time.This will easily make my top ten list for the year.Grade: A+"
"The Holdovers","Xstal","28 November 2023",810,"Now here's a film with a life affirming theme, that should encourage most viewers to think of their dreams, and cascade away all their cloaks, inhibitions, and open fresh doors to their heart's intuitions; as a teacher whose life is as stale as dead fish, whose life is the opposite of happy and bliss, meets a boy who's ignored by all those he holds dear, and a friendship is formed that is warm and sincere; it's a subtle reflection of how we get trapped, by tradition and habits and past circumstance, where surroundings like prisons can temper our thinking, to distil all our spirit, to bottles for drinking; so embrace all the chances when they come along, break out of that mould and sing your own song, open your eyes to the paths unexplored, take a stand and stand tall, and stop being ignored."
"The Holdovers","steiner-sam","10 November 2023",910,"It's a comedy-drama set from December 16, 1970, to the first week of January 1971 in an exclusive boy's boarding school in New England and Boston, Massachusetts. It follows the experiences of the ""holdovers,"" that is, the students who cannot go home over the Christmas holidays and the two Barton staff left to supervise them during the holidays.There are five holdovers: Teddy Kountze (Brady Hepner), Jason Smith (Michael Provost), and Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa) are upper-class wealthy WASP students. Alex Ollerman (Ian Dolley) is a younger Mormon student whose parents are on a mission in South America. Ye-Joon Park (Jim Kaplan) is from South Korea.Left to supervise is Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti), an unmarried ancient history teacher who was once a student at Barton and has taught there all his career. He's a demanding curmudgeon who almost everyone dislikes. African American Mary Lamb (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), the head cook, is also present; her son, a Barton grad, has just been killed in Vietnam.The film follows the shared experiences of the holdovers, though four students leave after a week when a wealthy father takes them for a ski holiday. Paul cannot contact Angus's parents, so he must stay with Paul and Mary at Barton. We also meet the school's headmaster, Hardy Woodrup (Andrew Garman), his administrative assistant, Lydia Crane (Carrie Preston), and janitor Danny (Naheem Garcia).""The Holdovers"" is a delightful comedy leavened with wisdom as we learn the dark secrets that have shaped Paul Hunham and Angus Tully. Giamatti, Sessa, and Randolph are all excellent. The script unfolds the twists and turns superbly. ""The Holdovers"" is a great Christmas movie."
"The Holdovers","JohnDeSando","16 November 2023",NA,"""I find the world a bitter and complicated place. And it seems to feel the same way about me."" Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti)Teaching privileged boys at an elite new England prep school called Barton (think for example, Philips Exeter), might be the pinnacle of an academic's career. But not Paul Hunham in The Holdovers, an elite movie itself of the year.Paul should be teaching classics at an ivy school, not teaching entitled ""vermin,"" among the many sobriquets he tosses around about the fortunate young men to experience his brand of grumpy intellectualism and misanthropy. He prepares them for a world that won't always be coddling and protecting them as their family wealth so naturally does in their early years.Director Alexander Payne worked with Giamatti in Sideways, so he is prepared to have another winning cynical character who is endearing while distanced by negative temperament from normally positive fellow humans (Paul's last name, Hunham, suggests a distant connection with the better angels of humanity).As Paul accepts the assignment to supervise holdovers (exiled to Christmas vacation in the absence of parents or guardians), the number whittles down to just Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa, reminiscent of young, Timothy Chalamet and Adam Driver), who shares Paul's dark attitudes and, with the sharp writing of David Hemingson, some witty dialogue- e.g., about Paul he says, ""I thought all of the Nazis had left for Argentina.""Although, as in likeminded dramas such as Dead Poet's Society or Goodbye, Mr. Chips, the principals are destined to be transformed into more humane characters, Holdovers continues, even in its denouement, to accentuate the unsunny side of life for Paul and Tully, whose fortunes are still compromised by cold-hearted parents and administrators. The chilly world, however, is warmed on these lovely, snowbound days, by women, viz., the cook, Mary (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) and administrator Lydia (Carrie Preston).Mary good-naturedly deals with the death of her son, Curtis, a Barton grad who had to join the military because he did not have the resources as other Barton grads of the late '60s did to avoid the draft.Lydia, an attractive middle-aged staff member, holds the promise of a love interest for Paul, only to show how difficult it is for social exiles to enter the romantic mainstream.The Holdovers is a small gem of a move that will immediately remind buffs about Hal Ashby comedies of the same era like Harold & Maude, where character development is paramount and detachment from the mainstream is required to look at humanity clearly with its foibles and endearments.The Holdovers is a movie everyone can enjoy with endearing characters who share with us our moments about loneliness peppered with the possibilities of love and happiness.""Do you think I want to be babysitting you? No. I was praying your mother would pick up the phone, or your father would arrive in a helicopter or a flying saucer...."" Paul Hunham."
"The Holdovers","dtswpod","6 November 2023",810,"Do you miss how they used to make films in the 1970s? Plenty of filmmakers do, except they take that nostalgia and just do watered down versions of better movies. As an example see Taxi Driver and King of Comedy then watch Joker and you'll get what I mean.Thankfully, Alexander Payne has managed to take his sentimentality and make an original film out of it. Or if The Holdovers is a pale imitation of a superior picture then the filmmaker has managed to trick me because I don't feel as if I've seen this movie before but done better.Now to be clear, there aren't things you've never seen before in the movie. I mean, you know the characters are going to bond at some point. And people will grow to care about each other. That's a given. How we get there, however, is what makes the film seem fresh and entertaining and ever bit as good as any flick made back in the day.I hope more people see it."
"The Holdovers","tdwillis-26273","7 December 2023",810,"Finally......a GOOD movie. The story/script, although not a breakthrough idea, was heartfelt,full and real.The settings were also real and gorgeous (not really a cgi fan)
Camera, cinematography, lighting,sound,score....every level made my eyes and ears satisfyingly full.Acting was oscarworthy across the board.Directing was brilliant.Only negative I can come up with is that the pace was a bit slow, but so much of the movie is so focused and so superbly and beautifully made I just sat back and enjoyed it.A very thoughtful substantial and beautiful movie. A rare gem in today's superficial gimmicky movie making world."
"The Holdovers","ferguson-6","8 November 2023",810,"Greetings again from the darkness. We've all had that teacher. You know, the one with an evil streak who just seemed to thrive on making students miserable. Throw in a staff and administrators who feel the same way, and the casting choice for the teacher becomes obvious. Enter the always great and perfectly curmudgeonly Paul Giamatti. This is the first time Giamatti has worked with two-time Oscar winner Alexander Payne since their brilliant SIDEWAYS (2004), and it's clear these two share a wavelength for comedy and drama, even in throwback form.Paul Hunham (Giamatti) is a long-time professor at Barton Academy, an all-boys private prep school located in the snowy northeast. It's December 1970, and an early scene exemplifies how he relishes the failing grades he bestows upon desperate students so afraid to disappoint their rich parents. In the final class before the holiday break, the student-teacher banter doesn't go so well for the boys, and they head to break with an extra workload. Hunham is easily manipulated into babysitting the titular holdovers - students stuck at school over the break, while most others spend time with family, often on exotic trips.Initially there are five students, but after a certain development, what remains is Hunham, smart but troubled Angus Tully (first timer Dominic Sessa) and the school's head cook, Mary Lamb (a divine Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019). Hunham is perpetually annoyed and has a weakness for booze. Angus is frustrated that his mother left him at school so she could travel with her new husband, and Mary is grieving over her son who was killed in Vietnam. Watching these three struggle to bond is a case study in psychology, yet of course we know they will ultimately form a family of misfits, depending on each other to offset the loneliness.The genius tagline for the film is ""Discomfort and Joy"", and initially the first overshadows the latter. Isolated from the world in their own way, the three characters begin to influence each other, showing broken/wounded people need and deserve love and friendship as much as anyone else. ""Entre nous"" (just between us) becomes a kind of calling card for this trio, and a Christmas party thrown by an eternally optimistic staffer (Carrie Preston) is a turning point.Giamatti is master of this material and only goes over the top a time or two. It's painful and humorous each time he is so anxious to infuse his breadth of ancient civilization facts into even the most mundane conversations. Newcomer Sessa possesses star potential and nails a complex first role. Da'Vine Joy Randolph's Mary is the heart of the film, doling out advice to Hunham and comfort to Angus. Depression is a vein running through these characters and it's acknowledged, though not the focus.This is Alexander Payne's first film since the disappointing DOWNSIZING (2017), but his brilliance has been proven in ABOUT SCHMIDT (2002), SIDEWAYS (2004), THE DESCENDANTS (2011), and NEBRASKA (2013). This time he's working from a screenplay by successful TV writer, David Hemingson, and though there is never much suspense about where the story or characters are headed, we enjoy the ride immensely. Cinematography from Eigil Byrld (IN BRUGES, 2008), perfectly complements the emotions (shot on digital, graininess added in post), and the soundtrack is period-specific, including the great Cat Stevens. Pay attention to the retro opening credits and logos, and enjoy a smart and funny film (an Alexander Payne trademark).Opening in theaters November 10, 2023."
"The Holdovers","akcenat","1 January 2024",810,"""The Holdovers"" is a captivating blend of comedy and drama that beautifully explores the complexities of human relationships.Story is about a grumpy instructor (Paul Giamatti) at a New England prep school who forms an unexpected bond with a troubled student during the Christmas break. Because it is set in the 1970s, the film in a way is a nostalgic journey back in time, but with a narrative that is both engaging and thought-provoking.The performances are exceptional, with Giamatti delivering a compelling portrayal of a man grappling with his own loneliness and the challenges of mentorship. The film's narrative is richly layered, exploring themes of loneliness, friendship, and personal growth. It's a story that resonates, offering a poignant reflection on the human condition. The film's setting in the 1970s adds a layer of nostalgia, further enhancing the emotional depth of the narrative. Despite its lengthy runtime, ""The Holdovers"" mostly maintains a steady pace, balancing its dramatic elements with moments of humor and warmth. The main plus of the movie is its dialogue-driven approach that adds to its charm, creating a sense of authenticity and depth in its character interactions.Overall, this is a film that leaves a lasting impression, offering a thoughtful exploration of human relationships set against the backdrop of a bygone era. With its exceptional performances and engaging narrative, I'm giving it an 8 out of 10 rating. It's a must-watch for those seeking a film that combines drama, comedy, and a touch of nostalgia."
"The Holdovers","Quinoa1984","30 October 2023",1010,"The Holdovers is, for all of the character dynamics and dysfunction and depression and other things we find out about the leads, mostly with Mr. Hunham and Angus and how their characters over these couple of weeks turn away from the ""Barton"" way of not telling lies (because, well, sometimes context and the moment matter for telling a lie that won't really hurt, maybe), a strangely comforting film to watch. Not for all of that exactly, though what we understand slowly but surely is this is all material for comedy and tragedy in equal measure, but because of the feeling that we get with a filmmaker who is so primed and confident with material that you don't feel like it can go wrong.What is more impressive is that, as enjoyable as the first half is, it is in the ""I like this"" mode as we are introduced to this world and Hunham and Angus and Mary, but it doesn't feel so special. But I should have known Payne and writer David Hemingson were laying down the necessary groundwork for what comes the moment a) the majority of the other supporting characters leave for reasons I don't have to mention here, and b) then the characters go outside the Barton campus grounds on a holiday party and then a ""field trip"" to Boston, you get the sense moment by moment and interaction by interaction it is so sharp and cutting and wise, and one scene in particular makes the jump into ""oh, OK, this is taking off into another level of personal pain and about familial expectations and what will come with in a life measuring up to others - and why that is wrong - and... yeah, it's great"" territory.In other words, it's the kind of film I want to watch again right away simply because now that I know a little more about the characters, I'll want to experience all of the extra textures (its 1970 down to the wood paneling and the car seats), and dig a little more into those absolutely wonderful natural restrained and complete performances - we take Giamatti for granted sometimes and this is a character he should be proud of to craft, lazy-ass eyes and all; Sessa's first role and he is an immediate star; I can't be more sure of anything for the next Oscar's that, if Randolph is nominated, she will win, if nothing else for everything she does at the Christmas party scenes, and a moment looking over some objects in a room later on is so moving - and my comfort is in seeing Payne clearly loving directing this intimate character study where he can show what a comedically observant, quick witted, and heartbreaking story this all is.It's one of the best Christmas movies in several years, embodying many themes and ideals that fit like a 70s wool sweater, and I'm sure the first thing Payne must have thought after reading the script was ""whoa. This is gonna be the best Hal Ashby or Bob Rafelson movie never made... is 'The Last Holdover' too on the nose?"" Even Hunham would give this... a B+ probably (did he ever give As? Shrug)."
"The Holdovers","jjgonzalez-06426","31 October 2023",910,"Quite possibly one of the best Christmas films ever? I first saw Payne & Giamatti's previous film together, ""Sideways"" during my screenwriting training class, and it is one that I would think of for a while. Their new film, ""The Holdovers"", is hilarious, beautifully shot and acted, heartwarming, and has a great sense of grief and joy meshed together. Definitely leaning towards Randolph for Best Supporting Actress; her performance BLEW me away.Overall, I love these films. Light-hearted & comedic while also have a sense of darkness and a lot of heavy emotion to it. Definitely is one of the most heartfelt films of the year."
"The Holdovers","paul-allaer","20 November 2023",810,"As ""The Holdovers"" (2023 release; 133 min.) opens, it's 1970 and we are at the Barton HS boarding school in New England as the Fall semester wraps up. Paul Hunham, a teacher of classical studies and a curmudgeon, gets summoned by the head of school, and is told he will take charge of the 4 or 5 ""holdovers"", students who for one reason or another, cannot go home and need to stay at the boarding school for the entire Christmas break... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest from director Alexander Payne (""Sideways"", ""The Descendants""). Here he brings to the big screen what life is like in Fall of 1970 among a group of privileged HS students along with their testy classics teacher and a Black woman who runs the kitchen. On the surface of it all, this looks to be a terrible combination, but as the movie plays out, more and more is revealed. The movie is plot-heavy and I shan't say another word on that. Paul Giamatti, a regular of Payne's prior movie work, brings what I feel is one of his strongest movie roles ever. Da'Vine Joy Randolph is outstanding as the Black kitchen supervisor with a heavy heart. Dominic Sessa is frankly too old (33 in real life) to play the rebellious HS student Angus (17 in the movie), I mean, it's really really obvious. That said, Payne just hits all the right notes in this film, and this resonated with me on so many levels. Despite the serious undertones, there are quite a few funny moments in the movie as well.""The Holdovers"" premiered a few months ago at the Telluride film festival to immediate and widespread critical acclaim. There is good reason why this is currently rated 87% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. The movie opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati the weekend before last. The early Sunday evening screening where I saw this at was attended so-so (about 12-15 people). If you are in the mood for a top-notch comedy drama, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion."
"The Holdovers","imseeg","14 December 2023",610,"I am big fan of director Alexander Payne (The Descendants, Sideways) and of actor Paul Giamatti in particular. Both have teamed up before with marvellous results, but this movie has got 1 problem that made me only rate it with 6 stars though:The bad:the middle part of this story stretches out too long, with several quite tedious scenes, which could have easily been cut out of it without hurting the storyline. I started watching at my watch half way through several times because of this lack of spark and punch. Such a pity!Fortunately this movie picked up momentum again towards the warmhearted Christmas spirited final, but I still will only award this movie with 6 stars (instead of 7) because I got bored at many moments during the somewhat tedious and long middle part.The story: It's about a young student and his teacher, who both are lonely souls and although they cant stand each other at first, eventually slowly do bond with each other during a Christmas holiday. Acting by Paul Giamatti is masterful (as always), BUT some of the other actors fail to impress me.Not the best of director Alexander Payne's work, but definitely still worth a watch, because it left me in my seat with a smile on my face and a feel good Christmas spirit of caring for one another!"
"The Holdovers","cparousis-30615","1 January 2024",1010,"Sad, poignant, funny, and beautiful are words that best describe this film. If this film doesn't make you feel sone kind of emotion, you are absolutely heartless. You love these characters. You feel for them on every single level. The film itself feels like a film from the 70s. The twists and turns the film takes are wonderful and heartwarming/heartbreaking. Paul Giamatti is excellent as always. This is Dominic Sessa's first film and he does an outstanding job. No crazy special effects or bloated explosions. Just great filmmaking. It's streaming on Peacock. An absolute holiday must. Take the time to watch it. You'll love it."
"The Holdovers","arfdawg-1","26 December 2023",510,"Lots of great reviews here. Many people who have seen Sideways seem to be excited that Giamatti has re-teamed with Payne the director.Of course, the film is in no way related to the other movie, except that both were involved and that Sideways has quite a cult following.Unfortunately this is not my type of movie. I'm not saying it's bad. And I'm not saying anything bad about the people who seem to love it. It's just not for me.It's a character driven movie, which is fine, except I didnt bond with any of the characters. And I found the choice of musical tunes throughout to be annoying at best.So if you like drawn out period piece character driven flicks, you may like this one. I didn't love it, but I could see how some might, hence the ""5"" rating."
"The Holdovers","kevin_robbins","31 December 2023",910,"My wife and I watched The Holdovers (2023) on Peacock last night. The storyline unfolds at a boarding school in Massachusetts during holiday vacation, focusing on the kids with nowhere to go for the holidays and the staff assigned to care for them, who happen to be facing a similar issue. Together, they work to uncover inner demons and find a way to release them, allowing everyone to truly enjoy the holiday season.Directed by Alexander Payne (Sideways), the film stars Paul Giamatti (American Splendor), Da'Vine Joy Randolph (Dolemite is my Name), Dominic Sessa, and Carrie Preston (Claws).This is an exceptionally unique holiday film, offering intriguing settings, characters, and circumstances. All facets are fascinating and worthwhile, with outstanding writing that establishes the storyline and various subplots effectively. The dialogue is absolutely superb, featuring a well-balanced blend of raw emotion, character development, and comedy. The eyebrow-raising conclusion is perfect for the characters' concluding direction.In conclusion, The Holdovers is a unique and captivating character piece that's an absolute must-see. I would score this a 9/10 and strongly recommend it."
"The Holdovers","euroGary","19 October 2023",1010,"One does not expect a Christmas film to be challenging, and this one certainly isn't. But it is a lot of fun.A boys' boarding school empties of almost all staff and pupils for the 1970/1 Festive Season. Left behind are Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti), the unpopular history teacher who has to keep an eye on the school; Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa), a teenaged pupil whose mother does not want him on her honeymoon; and Mary Lamb (the impressively-named Da'Vine Joy Randolph), the school cook who is facing her first Christmas alone since her son died on military service. As these three lonely souls come together, there are tantrums, emotional revelations, the revealing of long-hidden secrets, a noble sacrifice... the usual stuff.Also the usual stuff are the characters: Paul is cynical and frustrated; Angus is ironic and insecure; and as Mary is overweight and black, she of course has to be sassy.But while in some films such predictability would be annoying, it works here. Within the limits of their somewhat two-dimensional personalities, the characters are well-written - even Angus' tantrums do not seem unreasonable. Plus, there are some great gags (""You hit him? You mean you punched him out?"" ""No, I hit him with a car..."") And I will not be the only viewer who finishes the film with a lump in his throat.Great fun. I can easily see myself buying the DVD and watching this for many Christmases to come..."
"The Holdovers","cherold","31 December 2023",810,"This movie is about a handful of entitled boys who regretfully must stay behind during the Christmas break at their private school and the teacher and cook there to oversee them.It's a funny and affecting movie with excellent performances from the leads, especially Paul giamatti as the prickly teacher.It's a Christmas movie of sorts, since it does take place at Christmas, but it's really more of an anytime of the year film in which you get to see people have adventures and fight and grow and that sort of thing.It's very well filmed, it's very entertaining, and I would recommend you watch it."
"The Holdovers","bastille-852-731547","29 October 2023",610,"Set in December 1970, ""The Holdovers"" follows a small group of students who have to stay on campus over the Christmas break at Barton Academy (a prestigious boarding school in Massachusetts,) alongside a curmudgeonly ancient history teacher (Paul Giamatti.) That sounds like a potentially amusing premise for a breezy comedy-drama, especially when Alexander Payne is directing. Having greatly enjoyed and admired several of Payne's previous films such as ""Sideways,"" ""The Descendants,"" and ""Nebraska,"" I was looking forward to this film. Overall, I found it to be simply fine and not up to par with the level of quality of most of Payne's films. There's nothing too wrong with it by any stretch of the imagination, but it's often generic and forgettable compared to Payne's other films.An indie dramedy like this film would generally be expected to be defined by being character- and writing-driven. Unfortunately, neither the characters nor the writing here are especially unique enough to structure a compelling plot around. Paul (Giamatti's character) is very generic, as is the rebellious student Angus, whose relationship with Paul is a pivotal part of the film. On a better note, Da'Vine Joy Randolph gives a strong and impactful performance as Mary, a cafeteria worker dealing with bereavement; her character is interestingly more dynamic and multi-dimensional than either Paul or Angus. The writing and humor is less unique, funny, or engaging than many of Payne's films, as the attempts at plot devices, character development, and humor often boil down to insult comedy between Paul and Angus--which, ultimately, wears out its welcome a bit, and actually causes a bit of collateral damage in making the film's tone and story feel less sincere. Regardless of the sincerity of the story, another thing that is clear here is that there needed to be a stronger and less predictable core to the plot in order for the film to remain engaging for its 133-minute runtime.The film's retro, 1970s-aesthetic is commendable and helps contribute to the atmosphere of the film, and there still are some sporadic sweet moments of Paul and Mary hanging out around the television and a few decent jokes here and there. So ""The Holdovers"" is a fine enough film, but it won't be a new holiday classic for me. 6/10."
"The Holdovers","RahulM007","31 October 2023",1010,"""Penis cancer in human form.""Alexander Payne's ""The Holdovers"" is a laugh-out-loud comedy strengthened by Paul Giamatti and Dominic Sessa's magnetic performances and their incredible chemistry together. I am in awe by the film's brilliant and inventive screenplay, 70s-style cinematography, slick editing, and great production design. I could watch Paul and Angus bicker for another two hours. Throughout the film, the humour gets more interwoven leading to a crescendo of hilarity. ""The Holdovers"" offers the perfect blend of humor and pathos.*That waitress was so rude for refusing to accept their order of cherries jubilee. She is a fascist and a ""penis cancer in human form"".*The film reminded me of Peter Weir's ""Dead Poets Society"", Milos Forman's ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", and John Hughes' ""The Breakfast Club"" (kind of).Final verdict: 10/10."
"The Holdovers","Avwillfan89","29 November 2023",910,"Finally, Alexander Payne has made a worthy follow up to his (in my opinion at least) masterpiece Sideways.I really related so much to all three of the main characters, who all come from different backgrounds. Paul Giamatti, brilliant in almost anything he does, plays a grumpy, alcoholic, sour professor who does not suffer fools and doesn't cut his privileged students any slack. Dominic Sessa is troubled teen with a dysfunctional family and mental issues. D'Avine Joy Randolf is a grieving mother stuck in a job wanting to make ends meet for her family, by her choice.This movie has great character development, a wholesome story with flawed yet lovable characters you can root for and terrific, funny dialogue. Simple, yet perfect. 9 out of 10."
"The Holdovers","frankde-jong","27 December 2023",910,"I had a lot of associations when I started watching ""The holdovers"".Kids stuck in a school during the Christmas vacation, is that not a little bit like ""The breakfast club"" (1985, John Hughes)? No, because most of the kids go away early in the film and we are left with just one pupil (Angus Tully played by Dominic Sessa) and a teacher (Paul Hunham played by Paul Giamatti).Paul Hunham teaches ancient languages and culture. Does that sounds like the Donna Tartt novel ""The secret history"" (1992)? No, in that novel the pupils are inspired by their teacher. In ""The holdovers"" the teacher is hated.One association that I did not have at all prior to watching the movie may be the most accurate: ""Scent of a woman"" (1992, Martin Brest). Also in this film a high school pupil on an expensive boarding school and a grumpy old man are condemned to each other.Best of all however we can see ""The holdovers"" as the comeback of Alexander Payne after his failed film ""Downsizing"" (2017). The film is situated in 1970 and has a very 70's look and feel, down to the aspect ratio then used. The film also contains very beautiful images of Norteast American landscapes.First of all however the film is about its three main characters. Apart from the two already introduced we have the chief cook of the boarding school Mary Lamb (Da'Vine Joy Randolph). These three people form a sort of substitute family that has to spend the Christmas season together. Each of them has his/her problems but during the film they grow closer to each other, or at least learn to understand each other better.Being a Christmas movie you expect a happy ending and somewhere in the middle of the film this happy ending seems to consist of all the members of the proxy family being on their way towards an unexpected romance. The greatness of the film is that these romances do not materialize fully. The message of the film seems to be that gaining better understanding is a happy enough ending.By the way the film does not shy away from some social criticism. The character of Paul Hunham is meant to be grumpy at first, but to me he was instantly sympathetic when he made the headmaster of the boarding school very clear that in his class wealthy parents could not buy good grades for their sons. Later he says to his pupils (at that stage of the film there are still a couple of them) that they ought to be aware of their privileged status. ""You go to Harvard, poorer boys go to Vietnam"". The Vietnam war plays an important role in the background anyway. The son of the chief cook has died in Vietnam and while visiting a bar in the village nearby the boarding school there is a local boy that lost one of his hands in Vietnam.All in all ""The holdovers"" is a very convincing comeback of Alexander Payne. He made an instant Christmas classic!"
"The Holdovers","210west","14 January 2024",410,"Alexander Payne's 1999 comedy ""Election,"" set in a Midwestern high school, was brilliant, sometimes painful, sometimes hilarious. Best of all (I say this as a onetime high school teacher), it felt refreshingly authentic.""The Holdovers"" is quite the opposite: contrived, predictable, and intended to teach -- you guessed it -- a little lesson in compassion. An hour into it, I realized that it hadn't yet contained a single moment that seemed genuine, much less surprising. Every line of dialogue sounds phony. Characters speak in little announcements, spelling things out for us. Some of the characters -- a couple of menacing townies, for example -- are mere cartoons.Giamatti's protagonist is a wholly artificial creation, designed as if in a screenwriting course to follow the approved character arc -- initially stuffy and unsympathetic to the point of caricature, ultimately vulnerable. Ironically, an early scene between him and the school's headmaster violates what's sometimes regarded as a screenwriting rule: Do NOT, even in the interest of exposition, have people telling each other what they already know. (The by-the-numbers triteness of that conversation -- meant to show us that the instructor is uncompromising and pedantic but possesses old-fashioned integrity, blah blah blah -- put me off from the start.) The scenes between Giamatti and the school's cook -- in which, with the audience in mind, the two provide personal backstories and reveal their inner selves -- are painfully heavy-handed and at times so gooey that I felt sorry for the actress: ""You can't even dream a whole dream, can you?"" she is made to say at one point. ""What are you afraid of?""Yes, I know, everybody seems to love the movie. I could barely stomach it. But do check out ""Election."""
"The Holdovers","bdesdes","30 October 2023",810,"Very enjoyable film with outstanding performances and a wonderful warm vibe accompanied by the Christmas season. It's funny at times, sad at times, and feel-good. It's a story that almost all can relate to and will really touch your heart. It deals with so many themes, but mainly grief, the past, family, and what makes a person who they are. It's also very original and has a great script, cinematography, and soundtrack. I would highly advise to see it in the theaters as well as you really get the 70's vibe and deep moment on the big screen. There aren't many negatives to this film and I would recommend it to most people."
"The Holdovers","aharmas","29 October 2023",1010,"Here is a film that feels and looks like something out of the early seventies. The Holdovers is a strong and warm-hearted piece that gives actors roles with powerful lines, without any reliance on flashy editing and being overwhelmed by special effects.The story is simple three people get stuck for the Christmas holidays in a boarding school. It's cold, lonely, and boring for the parties involved. The adults drink to cope with whatever pressures they live with. The young man resorts to bad behavior and altercations with the teacher in charge.Through the vacation period these people will get to interact and get to know each other, something that will prove to a challenge to say the least. As the story evolves, we get to understand what has made the people who they are. We get to feel their pain and frustration through the very insightful writing of the director.It's a strong film with superb acting by the main leads. They have great chemistry together.Most outstanding is Paul Giamatti who plays the tormented and defensive man with relish and speaks volumes with his eyes.Hope the academy honors his performance as the best the year because no one else so far is coming close."
"The Holdovers","darkreignn","29 October 2023",910,"Let's just get this out of the way now - when it comes to writing this review, I'm probably a little bit biased (and a little bit drunk, currently, but that's besides the point). You see, I have an affinity for indie coming of age movies, and ""The Holdovers"" is basically an indie coming of age film, so it may - or may not - come as a surprise to you that I absolutely adored this picture. So, with that little preface out of the way, it's time for me to gush over this movie.Starring none other than Paul Giamatti as Paul Hunham, Giamatti plays a professor at an all boys boarding school where, over Christmas break, he has the misfortune of looking over a group of boys, one of whom is named Angus, played by Dominic Sessa. After a rocky start, where Paul clearly doesn't get along with any of the boys, making his disdain clear and evident, he eventually finds himself alone with Angus - as well as with the school's cook, Mary Lamb, played by Da'Vine Joy Randolph - in an unexpected chain of events. What occurs after is a slice-of-life style piece of cinema that allows broken people to find comfort in each other's company.""The Holdovers"" is, without a doubt, one of my favorite movies of 2023, as well as probably one of the best movies of the year, as well. This Christmas-themed gem doesn't hold back on the drama, delivering a thoughtful blend of comedy, coming-of-age storytelling, and a touch of romance - all wrapped around a very raw, human plot-line that virtually everyone can relate to. I'm no spring chicken myself, but I found myself deeply connected to both main characters - one who is older and basically dejected with life as he knows it, and one who is younger but who feels lost, aimless, and disconnected from both family and friends. And admittedly, not everyone will have a direct parallel to these experiences, but even if you don't, you're in for a story that's bound to tug at your heartstrings... and make you laugh out loud in the process.This is a high-quality movie - from the impeccable acting to the beautiful on-location cinematography to the relatable, thought-provoking plot, every element is executed with pinpoint precision and finesse; it's a testament to the art of storytelling on the silver screen. Director Alexander Payne knows how to create an artful film, and ""The Holdovers"" is no exception. It's at once indie and art-house while simultaneously being mainstream and easily accessible; in short, it's a film for everyone that actually feels like a genuine crowdpleaser instead of a pandering mess.I'm having a difficult time describing what I liked about this movie, and the reason is because I liked almost everything about this movie. So why the 9 out of 10 rating instead of the perfect 10? Literally the only thing that's holding me back is because I would've liked a touch more romance; yes, there was romance here, but a bit more would've pushed me over the edge into 10 out of 10 territory. Besides that, this is basically a perfect film, one that I loved, and one that has become one of my favorite movies of the year, if not of all time. I am genuinely looking forward to rewatching this, and I can't wait until it becomes closer to Christmas so I can view this on my own TV, cuddled under blankets, with a glass of whiskey, and bask in the absolute heartwarming experience that is ""The Holdovers."" My recommendation: Do yourself a favor and watch this as soon as you can - you won't regret it."
"The Holdovers","evanston_dad","20 November 2023",1010,"Mid-way through ""The Holdovers,"" I started openly weeping in the movie theater, and I pretty much kept it up on and off for the rest of the movie. Sometimes, there wasn't even anything obviously sad or moving happening in the scene, and I still couldn't stop. I think it's because this movie is so kind, and kindness is a rare commodity these days. It's sad to think that a movie about characters learning to have compassion for each other and for the hardships they've been through should feel like such a rare beast, but here we are.This is Alexander Payne firing on all cylinders as a director, and though he didn't write this movie, it feels like he could have. It's an obvious throwback to the kinds of movies Hal Ashby made throughout the 1970s and is touching in exactly the same way ""Harold and Maude"" was. It's also a master class in acting from the three principal characters played by Paul Giamatti, Dominic Sessa, and Da 'Vine Joy Randolph, and I hope all three of them, and the movie overall, is remembered come Oscar time.This will easily make my top ten list for the year.Grade: A+"
"The Holdovers","Xstal","28 November 2023",810,"Now here's a film with a life affirming theme, that should encourage most viewers to think of their dreams, and cascade away all their cloaks, inhibitions, and open fresh doors to their heart's intuitions; as a teacher whose life is as stale as dead fish, whose life is the opposite of happy and bliss, meets a boy who's ignored by all those he holds dear, and a friendship is formed that is warm and sincere; it's a subtle reflection of how we get trapped, by tradition and habits and past circumstance, where surroundings like prisons can temper our thinking, to distil all our spirit, to bottles for drinking; so embrace all the chances when they come along, break out of that mould and sing your own song, open your eyes to the paths unexplored, take a stand and stand tall, and stop being ignored."
"The Holdovers","steiner-sam","10 November 2023",910,"It's a comedy-drama set from December 16, 1970, to the first week of January 1971 in an exclusive boy's boarding school in New England and Boston, Massachusetts. It follows the experiences of the ""holdovers,"" that is, the students who cannot go home over the Christmas holidays and the two Barton staff left to supervise them during the holidays.There are five holdovers: Teddy Kountze (Brady Hepner), Jason Smith (Michael Provost), and Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa) are upper-class wealthy WASP students. Alex Ollerman (Ian Dolley) is a younger Mormon student whose parents are on a mission in South America. Ye-Joon Park (Jim Kaplan) is from South Korea.Left to supervise is Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti), an unmarried ancient history teacher who was once a student at Barton and has taught there all his career. He's a demanding curmudgeon who almost everyone dislikes. African American Mary Lamb (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), the head cook, is also present; her son, a Barton grad, has just been killed in Vietnam.The film follows the shared experiences of the holdovers, though four students leave after a week when a wealthy father takes them for a ski holiday. Paul cannot contact Angus's parents, so he must stay with Paul and Mary at Barton. We also meet the school's headmaster, Hardy Woodrup (Andrew Garman), his administrative assistant, Lydia Crane (Carrie Preston), and janitor Danny (Naheem Garcia).""The Holdovers"" is a delightful comedy leavened with wisdom as we learn the dark secrets that have shaped Paul Hunham and Angus Tully. Giamatti, Sessa, and Randolph are all excellent. The script unfolds the twists and turns superbly. ""The Holdovers"" is a great Christmas movie."
"The Holdovers","JohnDeSando","16 November 2023",NA,"""I find the world a bitter and complicated place. And it seems to feel the same way about me."" Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti)Teaching privileged boys at an elite new England prep school called Barton (think for example, Philips Exeter), might be the pinnacle of an academic's career. But not Paul Hunham in The Holdovers, an elite movie itself of the year.Paul should be teaching classics at an ivy school, not teaching entitled ""vermin,"" among the many sobriquets he tosses around about the fortunate young men to experience his brand of grumpy intellectualism and misanthropy. He prepares them for a world that won't always be coddling and protecting them as their family wealth so naturally does in their early years.Director Alexander Payne worked with Giamatti in Sideways, so he is prepared to have another winning cynical character who is endearing while distanced by negative temperament from normally positive fellow humans (Paul's last name, Hunham, suggests a distant connection with the better angels of humanity).As Paul accepts the assignment to supervise holdovers (exiled to Christmas vacation in the absence of parents or guardians), the number whittles down to just Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa, reminiscent of young, Timothy Chalamet and Adam Driver), who shares Paul's dark attitudes and, with the sharp writing of David Hemingson, some witty dialogue- e.g., about Paul he says, ""I thought all of the Nazis had left for Argentina.""Although, as in likeminded dramas such as Dead Poet's Society or Goodbye, Mr. Chips, the principals are destined to be transformed into more humane characters, Holdovers continues, even in its denouement, to accentuate the unsunny side of life for Paul and Tully, whose fortunes are still compromised by cold-hearted parents and administrators. The chilly world, however, is warmed on these lovely, snowbound days, by women, viz., the cook, Mary (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) and administrator Lydia (Carrie Preston).Mary good-naturedly deals with the death of her son, Curtis, a Barton grad who had to join the military because he did not have the resources as other Barton grads of the late '60s did to avoid the draft.Lydia, an attractive middle-aged staff member, holds the promise of a love interest for Paul, only to show how difficult it is for social exiles to enter the romantic mainstream.The Holdovers is a small gem of a move that will immediately remind buffs about Hal Ashby comedies of the same era like Harold & Maude, where character development is paramount and detachment from the mainstream is required to look at humanity clearly with its foibles and endearments.The Holdovers is a movie everyone can enjoy with endearing characters who share with us our moments about loneliness peppered with the possibilities of love and happiness.""Do you think I want to be babysitting you? No. I was praying your mother would pick up the phone, or your father would arrive in a helicopter or a flying saucer...."" Paul Hunham."
"The Holdovers","dtswpod","6 November 2023",810,"Do you miss how they used to make films in the 1970s? Plenty of filmmakers do, except they take that nostalgia and just do watered down versions of better movies. As an example see Taxi Driver and King of Comedy then watch Joker and you'll get what I mean.Thankfully, Alexander Payne has managed to take his sentimentality and make an original film out of it. Or if The Holdovers is a pale imitation of a superior picture then the filmmaker has managed to trick me because I don't feel as if I've seen this movie before but done better.Now to be clear, there aren't things you've never seen before in the movie. I mean, you know the characters are going to bond at some point. And people will grow to care about each other. That's a given. How we get there, however, is what makes the film seem fresh and entertaining and ever bit as good as any flick made back in the day.I hope more people see it."
"The Holdovers","tdwillis-26273","7 December 2023",810,"Finally......a GOOD movie. The story/script, although not a breakthrough idea, was heartfelt,full and real.The settings were also real and gorgeous (not really a cgi fan)
Camera, cinematography, lighting,sound,score....every level made my eyes and ears satisfyingly full.Acting was oscarworthy across the board.Directing was brilliant.Only negative I can come up with is that the pace was a bit slow, but so much of the movie is so focused and so superbly and beautifully made I just sat back and enjoyed it.A very thoughtful substantial and beautiful movie. A rare gem in today's superficial gimmicky movie making world."
"The Holdovers","ferguson-6","8 November 2023",810,"Greetings again from the darkness. We've all had that teacher. You know, the one with an evil streak who just seemed to thrive on making students miserable. Throw in a staff and administrators who feel the same way, and the casting choice for the teacher becomes obvious. Enter the always great and perfectly curmudgeonly Paul Giamatti. This is the first time Giamatti has worked with two-time Oscar winner Alexander Payne since their brilliant SIDEWAYS (2004), and it's clear these two share a wavelength for comedy and drama, even in throwback form.Paul Hunham (Giamatti) is a long-time professor at Barton Academy, an all-boys private prep school located in the snowy northeast. It's December 1970, and an early scene exemplifies how he relishes the failing grades he bestows upon desperate students so afraid to disappoint their rich parents. In the final class before the holiday break, the student-teacher banter doesn't go so well for the boys, and they head to break with an extra workload. Hunham is easily manipulated into babysitting the titular holdovers - students stuck at school over the break, while most others spend time with family, often on exotic trips.Initially there are five students, but after a certain development, what remains is Hunham, smart but troubled Angus Tully (first timer Dominic Sessa) and the school's head cook, Mary Lamb (a divine Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019). Hunham is perpetually annoyed and has a weakness for booze. Angus is frustrated that his mother left him at school so she could travel with her new husband, and Mary is grieving over her son who was killed in Vietnam. Watching these three struggle to bond is a case study in psychology, yet of course we know they will ultimately form a family of misfits, depending on each other to offset the loneliness.The genius tagline for the film is ""Discomfort and Joy"", and initially the first overshadows the latter. Isolated from the world in their own way, the three characters begin to influence each other, showing broken/wounded people need and deserve love and friendship as much as anyone else. ""Entre nous"" (just between us) becomes a kind of calling card for this trio, and a Christmas party thrown by an eternally optimistic staffer (Carrie Preston) is a turning point.Giamatti is master of this material and only goes over the top a time or two. It's painful and humorous each time he is so anxious to infuse his breadth of ancient civilization facts into even the most mundane conversations. Newcomer Sessa possesses star potential and nails a complex first role. Da'Vine Joy Randolph's Mary is the heart of the film, doling out advice to Hunham and comfort to Angus. Depression is a vein running through these characters and it's acknowledged, though not the focus.This is Alexander Payne's first film since the disappointing DOWNSIZING (2017), but his brilliance has been proven in ABOUT SCHMIDT (2002), SIDEWAYS (2004), THE DESCENDANTS (2011), and NEBRASKA (2013). This time he's working from a screenplay by successful TV writer, David Hemingson, and though there is never much suspense about where the story or characters are headed, we enjoy the ride immensely. Cinematography from Eigil Byrld (IN BRUGES, 2008), perfectly complements the emotions (shot on digital, graininess added in post), and the soundtrack is period-specific, including the great Cat Stevens. Pay attention to the retro opening credits and logos, and enjoy a smart and funny film (an Alexander Payne trademark).Opening in theaters November 10, 2023."
"The Holdovers","akcenat","1 January 2024",810,"""The Holdovers"" is a captivating blend of comedy and drama that beautifully explores the complexities of human relationships.Story is about a grumpy instructor (Paul Giamatti) at a New England prep school who forms an unexpected bond with a troubled student during the Christmas break. Because it is set in the 1970s, the film in a way is a nostalgic journey back in time, but with a narrative that is both engaging and thought-provoking.The performances are exceptional, with Giamatti delivering a compelling portrayal of a man grappling with his own loneliness and the challenges of mentorship. The film's narrative is richly layered, exploring themes of loneliness, friendship, and personal growth. It's a story that resonates, offering a poignant reflection on the human condition. The film's setting in the 1970s adds a layer of nostalgia, further enhancing the emotional depth of the narrative. Despite its lengthy runtime, ""The Holdovers"" mostly maintains a steady pace, balancing its dramatic elements with moments of humor and warmth. The main plus of the movie is its dialogue-driven approach that adds to its charm, creating a sense of authenticity and depth in its character interactions.Overall, this is a film that leaves a lasting impression, offering a thoughtful exploration of human relationships set against the backdrop of a bygone era. With its exceptional performances and engaging narrative, I'm giving it an 8 out of 10 rating. It's a must-watch for those seeking a film that combines drama, comedy, and a touch of nostalgia."
"The Holdovers","Quinoa1984","30 October 2023",1010,"The Holdovers is, for all of the character dynamics and dysfunction and depression and other things we find out about the leads, mostly with Mr. Hunham and Angus and how their characters over these couple of weeks turn away from the ""Barton"" way of not telling lies (because, well, sometimes context and the moment matter for telling a lie that won't really hurt, maybe), a strangely comforting film to watch. Not for all of that exactly, though what we understand slowly but surely is this is all material for comedy and tragedy in equal measure, but because of the feeling that we get with a filmmaker who is so primed and confident with material that you don't feel like it can go wrong.What is more impressive is that, as enjoyable as the first half is, it is in the ""I like this"" mode as we are introduced to this world and Hunham and Angus and Mary, but it doesn't feel so special. But I should have known Payne and writer David Hemingson were laying down the necessary groundwork for what comes the moment a) the majority of the other supporting characters leave for reasons I don't have to mention here, and b) then the characters go outside the Barton campus grounds on a holiday party and then a ""field trip"" to Boston, you get the sense moment by moment and interaction by interaction it is so sharp and cutting and wise, and one scene in particular makes the jump into ""oh, OK, this is taking off into another level of personal pain and about familial expectations and what will come with in a life measuring up to others - and why that is wrong - and... yeah, it's great"" territory.In other words, it's the kind of film I want to watch again right away simply because now that I know a little more about the characters, I'll want to experience all of the extra textures (its 1970 down to the wood paneling and the car seats), and dig a little more into those absolutely wonderful natural restrained and complete performances - we take Giamatti for granted sometimes and this is a character he should be proud of to craft, lazy-ass eyes and all; Sessa's first role and he is an immediate star; I can't be more sure of anything for the next Oscar's that, if Randolph is nominated, she will win, if nothing else for everything she does at the Christmas party scenes, and a moment looking over some objects in a room later on is so moving - and my comfort is in seeing Payne clearly loving directing this intimate character study where he can show what a comedically observant, quick witted, and heartbreaking story this all is.It's one of the best Christmas movies in several years, embodying many themes and ideals that fit like a 70s wool sweater, and I'm sure the first thing Payne must have thought after reading the script was ""whoa. This is gonna be the best Hal Ashby or Bob Rafelson movie never made... is 'The Last Holdover' too on the nose?"" Even Hunham would give this... a B+ probably (did he ever give As? Shrug)."
"The Holdovers","jjgonzalez-06426","31 October 2023",910,"Quite possibly one of the best Christmas films ever? I first saw Payne & Giamatti's previous film together, ""Sideways"" during my screenwriting training class, and it is one that I would think of for a while. Their new film, ""The Holdovers"", is hilarious, beautifully shot and acted, heartwarming, and has a great sense of grief and joy meshed together. Definitely leaning towards Randolph for Best Supporting Actress; her performance BLEW me away.Overall, I love these films. Light-hearted & comedic while also have a sense of darkness and a lot of heavy emotion to it. Definitely is one of the most heartfelt films of the year."
"The Holdovers","paul-allaer","20 November 2023",810,"As ""The Holdovers"" (2023 release; 133 min.) opens, it's 1970 and we are at the Barton HS boarding school in New England as the Fall semester wraps up. Paul Hunham, a teacher of classical studies and a curmudgeon, gets summoned by the head of school, and is told he will take charge of the 4 or 5 ""holdovers"", students who for one reason or another, cannot go home and need to stay at the boarding school for the entire Christmas break... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest from director Alexander Payne (""Sideways"", ""The Descendants""). Here he brings to the big screen what life is like in Fall of 1970 among a group of privileged HS students along with their testy classics teacher and a Black woman who runs the kitchen. On the surface of it all, this looks to be a terrible combination, but as the movie plays out, more and more is revealed. The movie is plot-heavy and I shan't say another word on that. Paul Giamatti, a regular of Payne's prior movie work, brings what I feel is one of his strongest movie roles ever. Da'Vine Joy Randolph is outstanding as the Black kitchen supervisor with a heavy heart. Dominic Sessa is frankly too old (33 in real life) to play the rebellious HS student Angus (17 in the movie), I mean, it's really really obvious. That said, Payne just hits all the right notes in this film, and this resonated with me on so many levels. Despite the serious undertones, there are quite a few funny moments in the movie as well.""The Holdovers"" premiered a few months ago at the Telluride film festival to immediate and widespread critical acclaim. There is good reason why this is currently rated 87% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. The movie opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati the weekend before last. The early Sunday evening screening where I saw this at was attended so-so (about 12-15 people). If you are in the mood for a top-notch comedy drama, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion."
"The Holdovers","imseeg","14 December 2023",610,"I am big fan of director Alexander Payne (The Descendants, Sideways) and of actor Paul Giamatti in particular. Both have teamed up before with marvellous results, but this movie has got 1 problem that made me only rate it with 6 stars though:The bad:the middle part of this story stretches out too long, with several quite tedious scenes, which could have easily been cut out of it without hurting the storyline. I started watching at my watch half way through several times because of this lack of spark and punch. Such a pity!Fortunately this movie picked up momentum again towards the warmhearted Christmas spirited final, but I still will only award this movie with 6 stars (instead of 7) because I got bored at many moments during the somewhat tedious and long middle part.The story: It's about a young student and his teacher, who both are lonely souls and although they cant stand each other at first, eventually slowly do bond with each other during a Christmas holiday. Acting by Paul Giamatti is masterful (as always), BUT some of the other actors fail to impress me.Not the best of director Alexander Payne's work, but definitely still worth a watch, because it left me in my seat with a smile on my face and a feel good Christmas spirit of caring for one another!"

If this film doesn't make you feel sone kind of emotion, you are absolutely heartless. You love these characters. You feel for them on every single level. The film itself feels like a film from the 70s. The twists and turns the film takes are wonderful and heartwarming/heartbreaking. Paul Giamatti is excellent as always. This is Dominic Sessa's first film and he does an outstanding job. No crazy special effects or bloated explosions. Just great filmmaking. It's streaming on Peacock. An absolute holiday must. Take the time to watch it. You'll love it."
"The Holdovers","arfdawg-1","26 December 2023",510,"Lots of great reviews here. Many people who have seen Sideways seem to be excited that Giamatti has re-teamed with Payne the director.Of course, the film is in no way related to the other movie, except that both were involved and that Sideways has quite a cult following.Unfortunately this is not my type of movie. I'm not saying it's bad. And I'm not saying anything bad about the people who seem to love it. It's just not for me.It's a character driven movie, which is fine, except I didnt bond with any of the characters. And I found the choice of musical tunes throughout to be annoying at best.So if you like drawn out period piece character driven flicks, you may like this one. I didn't love it, but I could see how some might, hence the ""5"" rating."
"The Holdovers","kevin_robbins","31 December 2023",910,"My wife and I watched The Holdovers (2023) on Peacock last night. The storyline unfolds at a boarding school in Massachusetts during holiday vacation, focusing on the kids with nowhere to go for the holidays and the staff assigned to care for them, who happen to be facing a similar issue. Together, they work to uncover inner demons and find a way to release them, allowing everyone to truly enjoy the holiday season.Directed by Alexander Payne (Sideways), the film stars Paul Giamatti (American Splendor), Da'Vine Joy Randolph (Dolemite is my Name), Dominic Sessa, and Carrie Preston (Claws).This is an exceptionally unique holiday film, offering intriguing settings, characters, and circumstances. All facets are fascinating and worthwhile, with outstanding writing that establishes the storyline and various subplots effectively. The dialogue is absolutely superb, featuring a well-balanced blend of raw emotion, character development, and comedy. The eyebrow-raising conclusion is perfect for the characters' concluding direction.In conclusion, The Holdovers is a unique and captivating character piece that's an absolute must-see. I would score this a 9/10 and strongly recommend it."
"The Holdovers","euroGary","19 October 2023",1010,"One does not expect a Christmas film to be challenging, and this one certainly isn't. But it is a lot of fun.A boys' boarding school empties of almost all staff and pupils for the 1970/1 Festive Season. Left behind are Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti), the unpopular history teacher who has to keep an eye on the school; Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa), a teenaged pupil whose mother does not want him on her honeymoon; and Mary Lamb (the impressively-named Da'Vine Joy Randolph), the school cook who is facing her first Christmas alone since her son died on military service. As these three lonely souls come together, there are tantrums, emotional revelations, the revealing of long-hidden secrets, a noble sacrifice... the usual stuff.Also the usual stuff are the characters: Paul is cynical and frustrated; Angus is ironic and insecure; and as Mary is overweight and black, she of course has to be sassy.But while in some films such predictability would be annoying, it works here. Within the limits of their somewhat two-dimensional personalities, the characters are well-written - even Angus' tantrums do not seem unreasonable. Plus, there are some great gags (""You hit him? You mean you punched him out?"" ""No, I hit him with a car..."") And I will not be the only viewer who finishes the film with a lump in his throat.Great fun. I can easily see myself buying the DVD and watching this for many Christmases to come..."
"The Holdovers","cherold","31 December 2023",810,"This movie is about a handful of entitled boys who regretfully must stay behind during the Christmas break at their private school and the teacher and cook there to oversee them.It's a funny and affecting movie with excellent performances from the leads, especially Paul giamatti as the prickly teacher.It's a Christmas movie of sorts, since it does take place at Christmas, but it's really more of an anytime of the year film in which you get to see people have adventures and fight and grow and that sort of thing.It's very well filmed, it's very entertaining, and I would recommend you watch it."
"The Holdovers","bastille-852-731547","29 October 2023",610,"Set in December 1970, ""The Holdovers"" follows a small group of students who have to stay on campus over the Christmas break at Barton Academy (a prestigious boarding school in Massachusetts,) alongside a curmudgeonly ancient history teacher (Paul Giamatti.) That sounds like a potentially amusing premise for a breezy comedy-drama, especially when Alexander Payne is directing. Having greatly enjoyed and admired several of Payne's previous films such as ""Sideways,"" ""The Descendants,"" and ""Nebraska,"" I was looking forward to this film. Overall, I found it to be simply fine and not up to par with the level of quality of most of Payne's films. There's nothing too wrong with it by any stretch of the imagination, but it's often generic and forgettable compared to Payne's other films.An indie dramedy like this film would generally be expected to be defined by being character- and writing-driven. Unfortunately, neither the characters nor the writing here are especially unique enough to structure a compelling plot around. Paul (Giamatti's character) is very generic, as is the rebellious student Angus, whose relationship with Paul is a pivotal part of the film. On a better note, Da'Vine Joy Randolph gives a strong and impactful performance as Mary, a cafeteria worker dealing with bereavement; her character is interestingly more dynamic and multi-dimensional than either Paul or Angus. The writing and humor is less unique, funny, or engaging than many of Payne's films, as the attempts at plot devices, character development, and humor often boil down to insult comedy between Paul and Angus--which, ultimately, wears out its welcome a bit, and actually causes a bit of collateral damage in making the film's tone and story feel less sincere. Regardless of the sincerity of the story, another thing that is clear here is that there needed to be a stronger and less predictable core to the plot in order for the film to remain engaging for its 133-minute runtime.The film's retro, 1970s-aesthetic is commendable and helps contribute to the atmosphere of the film, and there still are some sporadic sweet moments of Paul and Mary hanging out around the television and a few decent jokes here and there. So ""The Holdovers"" is a fine enough film, but it won't be a new holiday classic for me. 6/10."
"The Holdovers","RahulM007","31 October 2023",1010,"""Penis cancer in human form.""Alexander Payne's ""The Holdovers"" is a laugh-out-loud comedy strengthened by Paul Giamatti and Dominic Sessa's magnetic performances and their incredible chemistry together. I am in awe by the film's brilliant and inventive screenplay, 70s-style cinematography, slick editing, and great production design. I could watch Paul and Angus bicker for another two hours. Throughout the film, the humour gets more interwoven leading to a crescendo of hilarity. ""The Holdovers"" offers the perfect blend of humor and pathos.*That waitress was so rude for refusing to accept their order of cherries jubilee. She is a fascist and a ""penis cancer in human form"".*The film reminded me of Peter Weir's ""Dead Poets Society"", Milos Forman's ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", and John Hughes' ""The Breakfast Club"" (kind of).Final verdict: 10/10."
"The Holdovers","Avwillfan89","29 November 2023",910,"Finally, Alexander Payne has made a worthy follow up to his (in my opinion at least) masterpiece Sideways.I really related so much to all three of the main characters, who all come from different backgrounds. Paul Giamatti, brilliant in almost anything he does, plays a grumpy, alcoholic, sour professor who does not suffer fools and doesn't cut his privileged students any slack. Dominic Sessa is troubled teen with a dysfunctional family and mental issues. D'Avine Joy Randolf is a grieving mother stuck in a job wanting to make ends meet for her family, by her choice.This movie has great character development, a wholesome story with flawed yet lovable characters you can root for and terrific, funny dialogue. Simple, yet perfect. 9 out of 10."
"The Holdovers","frankde-jong","27 December 2023",910,"I had a lot of associations when I started watching ""The holdovers"".Kids stuck in a school during the Christmas vacation, is that not a little bit like ""The breakfast club"" (1985, John Hughes)? No, because most of the kids go away early in the film and we are left with just one pupil (Angus Tully played by Dominic Sessa) and a teacher (Paul Hunham played by Paul Giamatti).Paul Hunham teaches ancient languages and culture. Does that sounds like the Donna Tartt novel ""The secret history"" (1992)? No, in that novel the pupils are inspired by their teacher. In ""The holdovers"" the teacher is hated.One association that I did not have at all prior to watching the movie may be the most accurate: ""Scent of a woman"" (1992, Martin Brest). Also in this film a high school pupil on an expensive boarding school and a grumpy old man are condemned to each other.Best of all however we can see ""The holdovers"" as the comeback of Alexander Payne after his failed film ""Downsizing"" (2017). The film is situated in 1970 and has a very 70's look and feel, down to the aspect ratio then used. The film also contains very beautiful images of Norteast American landscapes.First of all however the film is about its three main characters. Apart from the two already introduced we have the chief cook of the boarding school Mary Lamb (Da'Vine Joy Randolph). These three people form a sort of substitute family that has to spend the Christmas season together. Each of them has his/her problems but during the film they grow closer to each other, or at least learn to understand each other better.Being a Christmas movie you expect a happy ending and somewhere in the middle of the film this happy ending seems to consist of all the members of the proxy family being on their way towards an unexpected romance. The greatness of the film is that these romances do not materialize fully. The message of the film seems to be that gaining better understanding is a happy enough ending.By the way the film does not shy away from some social criticism. The character of Paul Hunham is meant to be grumpy at first, but to me he was instantly sympathetic when he made the headmaster of the boarding school very clear that in his class wealthy parents could not buy good grades for their sons. Later he says to his pupils (at that stage of the film there are still a couple of them) that they ought to be aware of their privileged status. ""You go to Harvard, poorer boys go to Vietnam"". The Vietnam war plays an important role in the background anyway. The son of the chief cook has died in Vietnam and while visiting a bar in the village nearby the boarding school there is a local boy that lost one of his hands in Vietnam.All in all ""The holdovers"" is a very convincing comeback of Alexander Payne. He made an instant Christmas classic!"
"The Holdovers","210west","14 January 2024",410,"Alexander Payne's 1999 comedy ""Election,"" set in a Midwestern high school, was brilliant, sometimes painful, sometimes hilarious. Best of all (I say this as a onetime high school teacher), it felt refreshingly authentic.""The Holdovers"" is quite the opposite: contrived, predictable, and intended to teach -- you guessed it -- a little lesson in compassion. An hour into it, I realized that it hadn't yet contained a single moment that seemed genuine, much less surprising. Every line of dialogue sounds phony. Characters speak in little announcements, spelling things out for us. Some of the characters -- a couple of menacing townies, for example -- are mere cartoons.Giamatti's protagonist is a wholly artificial creation, designed as if in a screenwriting course to follow the approved character arc -- initially stuffy and unsympathetic to the point of caricature, ultimately vulnerable. Ironically, an early scene between him and the school's headmaster violates what's sometimes regarded as a screenwriting rule: Do NOT, even in the interest of exposition, have people telling each other what they already know. (The by-the-numbers triteness of that conversation -- meant to show us that the instructor is uncompromising and pedantic but possesses old-fashioned integrity, blah blah blah -- put me off from the start.) The scenes between Giamatti and the school's cook -- in which, with the audience in mind, the two provide personal backstories and reveal their inner selves -- are painfully heavy-handed and at times so gooey that I felt sorry for the actress: ""You can't even dream a whole dream, can you?"" she is made to say at one point. ""What are you afraid of?""Yes, I know, everybody seems to love the movie. I could barely stomach it. But do check out ""Election."""
"The Holdovers","bdesdes","30 October 2023",810,"Very enjoyable film with outstanding performances and a wonderful warm vibe accompanied by the Christmas season. It's funny at times, sad at times, and feel-good. It's a story that almost all can relate to and will really touch your heart. It deals with so many themes, but mainly grief, the past, family, and what makes a person who they are. It's also very original and has a great script, cinematography, and soundtrack. I would highly advise to see it in the theaters as well as you really get the 70's vibe and deep moment on the big screen. There aren't many negatives to this film and I would recommend it to most people."
"The Holdovers","aharmas","29 October 2023",1010,"Here is a film that feels and looks like something out of the early seventies. The Holdovers is a strong and warm-hearted piece that gives actors roles with powerful lines, without any reliance on flashy editing and being overwhelmed by special effects.The story is simple three people get stuck for the Christmas holidays in a boarding school. It's cold, lonely, and boring for the parties involved. The adults drink to cope with whatever pressures they live with. The young man resorts to bad behavior and altercations with the teacher in charge.Through the vacation period these people will get to interact and get to know each other, something that will prove to a challenge to say the least. As the story evolves, we get to understand what has made the people who they are. We get to feel their pain and frustration through the very insightful writing of the director.It's a strong film with superb acting by the main leads. They have great chemistry together.Most outstanding is Paul Giamatti who plays the tormented and defensive man with relish and speaks volumes with his eyes.Hope the academy honors his performance as the best the year because no one else so far is coming close."
"The Holdovers","darkreignn","29 October 2023",910,"Let's just get this out of the way now - when it comes to writing this review, I'm probably a little bit biased (and a little bit drunk, currently, but that's besides the point). You see, I have an affinity for indie coming of age movies, and ""The Holdovers"" is basically an indie coming of age film, so it may - or may not - come as a surprise to you that I absolutely adored this picture. So, with that little preface out of the way, it's time for me to gush over this movie.Starring none other than Paul Giamatti as Paul Hunham, Giamatti plays a professor at an all boys boarding school where, over Christmas break, he has the misfortune of looking over a group of boys, one of whom is named Angus, played by Dominic Sessa. After a rocky start, where Paul clearly doesn't get along with any of the boys, making his disdain clear and evident, he eventually finds himself alone with Angus - as well as with the school's cook, Mary Lamb, played by Da'Vine Joy Randolph - in an unexpected chain of events. What occurs after is a slice-of-life style piece of cinema that allows broken people to find comfort in each other's company.""The Holdovers"" is, without a doubt, one of my favorite movies of 2023, as well as probably one of the best movies of the year, as well. This Christmas-themed gem doesn't hold back on the drama, delivering a thoughtful blend of comedy, coming-of-age storytelling, and a touch of romance - all wrapped around a very raw, human plot-line that virtually everyone can relate to. I'm no spring chicken myself, but I found myself deeply connected to both main characters - one who is older and basically dejected with life as he knows it, and one who is younger but who feels lost, aimless, and disconnected from both family and friends. And admittedly, not everyone will have a direct parallel to these experiences, but even if you don't, you're in for a story that's bound to tug at your heartstrings... and make you laugh out loud in the process.This is a high-quality movie - from the impeccable acting to the beautiful on-location cinematography to the relatable, thought-provoking plot, every element is executed with pinpoint precision and finesse; it's a testament to the art of storytelling on the silver screen. Director Alexander Payne knows how to create an artful film, and ""The Holdovers"" is no exception. It's at once indie and art-house while simultaneously being mainstream and easily accessible; in short, it's a film for everyone that actually feels like a genuine crowdpleaser instead of a pandering mess.I'm having a difficult time describing what I liked about this movie, and the reason is because I liked almost everything about this movie. So why the 9 out of 10 rating instead of the perfect 10? Literally the only thing that's holding me back is because I would've liked a touch more romance; yes, there was romance here, but a bit more would've pushed me over the edge into 10 out of 10 territory. Besides that, this is basically a perfect film, one that I loved, and one that has become one of my favorite movies of the year, if not of all time. I am genuinely looking forward to rewatching this, and I can't wait until it becomes closer to Christmas so I can view this on my own TV, cuddled under blankets, with a glass of whiskey, and bask in the absolute heartwarming experience that is ""The Holdovers."" My recommendation: Do yourself a favor and watch this as soon as you can - you won't regret it."
"The Holdovers","evanston_dad","20 November 2023",1010,"Mid-way through ""The Holdovers,"" I started openly weeping in the movie theater, and I pretty much kept it up on and off for the rest of the movie. Sometimes, there wasn't even anything obviously sad or moving happening in the scene, and I still couldn't stop. I think it's because this movie is so kind, and kindness is a rare commodity these days. It's sad to think that a movie about characters learning to have compassion for each other and for the hardships they've been through should feel like such a rare beast, but here we are.This is Alexander Payne firing on all cylinders as a director, and though he didn't write this movie, it feels like he could have. It's an obvious throwback to the kinds of movies Hal Ashby made throughout the 1970s and is touching in exactly the same way ""Harold and Maude"" was. It's also a master class in acting from the three principal characters played by Paul Giamatti, Dominic Sessa, and Da 'Vine Joy Randolph, and I hope all three of them, and the movie overall, is remembered come Oscar time.This will easily make my top ten list for the year.Grade: A+"
"The Holdovers","Xstal","28 November 2023",810,"Now here's a film with a life affirming theme, that should encourage most viewers to think of their dreams, and cascade away all their cloaks, inhibitions, and open fresh doors to their heart's intuitions; as a teacher whose life is as stale as dead fish, whose life is the opposite of happy and bliss, meets a boy who's ignored by all those he holds dear, and a friendship is formed that is warm and sincere; it's a subtle reflection of how we get trapped, by tradition and habits and past circumstance, where surroundings like prisons can temper our thinking, to distil all our spirit, to bottles for drinking; so embrace all the chances when they come along, break out of that mould and sing your own song, open your eyes to the paths unexplored, take a stand and stand tall, and stop being ignored."
"The Holdovers","steiner-sam","10 November 2023",910,"It's a comedy-drama set from December 16, 1970, to the first week of January 1971 in an exclusive boy's boarding school in New England and Boston, Massachusetts. It follows the experiences of the ""holdovers,"" that is, the students who cannot go home over the Christmas holidays and the two Barton staff left to supervise them during the holidays.There are five holdovers: Teddy Kountze (Brady Hepner), Jason Smith (Michael Provost), and Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa) are upper-class wealthy WASP students. Alex Ollerman (Ian Dolley) is a younger Mormon student whose parents are on a mission in South America. Ye-Joon Park (Jim Kaplan) is from South Korea.Left to supervise is Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti), an unmarried ancient history teacher who was once a student at Barton and has taught there all his career. He's a demanding curmudgeon who almost everyone dislikes. African American Mary Lamb (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), the head cook, is also present; her son, a Barton grad, has just been killed in Vietnam.The film follows the shared experiences of the holdovers, though four students leave after a week when a wealthy father takes them for a ski holiday. Paul cannot contact Angus's parents, so he must stay with Paul and Mary at Barton. We also meet the school's headmaster, Hardy Woodrup (Andrew Garman), his administrative assistant, Lydia Crane (Carrie Preston), and janitor Danny (Naheem Garcia).""The Holdovers"" is a delightful comedy leavened with wisdom as we learn the dark secrets that have shaped Paul Hunham and Angus Tully. Giamatti, Sessa, and Randolph are all excellent. The script unfolds the twists and turns superbly. ""The Holdovers"" is a great Christmas movie."
"The Holdovers","JohnDeSando","16 November 2023",NA,"""I find the world a bitter and complicated place. And it seems to feel the same way about me."" Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti)Teaching privileged boys at an elite new England prep school called Barton (think for example, Philips Exeter), might be the pinnacle of an academic's career. But not Paul Hunham in The Holdovers, an elite movie itself of the year.Paul should be teaching classics at an ivy school, not teaching entitled ""vermin,"" among the many sobriquets he tosses around about the fortunate young men to experience his brand of grumpy intellectualism and misanthropy. He prepares them for a world that won't always be coddling and protecting them as their family wealth so naturally does in their early years.Director Alexander Payne worked with Giamatti in Sideways, so he is prepared to have another winning cynical character who is endearing while distanced by negative temperament from normally positive fellow humans (Paul's last name, Hunham, suggests a distant connection with the better angels of humanity).As Paul accepts the assignment to supervise holdovers (exiled to Christmas vacation in the absence of parents or guardians), the number whittles down to just Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa, reminiscent of young, Timothy Chalamet and Adam Driver), who shares Paul's dark attitudes and, with the sharp writing of David Hemingson, some witty dialogue- e.g., about Paul he says, ""I thought all of the Nazis had left for Argentina.""Although, as in likeminded dramas such as Dead Poet's Society or Goodbye, Mr. Chips, the principals are destined to be transformed into more humane characters, Holdovers continues, even in its denouement, to accentuate the unsunny side of life for Paul and Tully, whose fortunes are still compromised by cold-hearted parents and administrators. The chilly world, however, is warmed on these lovely, snowbound days, by women, viz., the cook, Mary (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) and administrator Lydia (Carrie Preston).Mary good-naturedly deals with the death of her son, Curtis, a Barton grad who had to join the military because he did not have the resources as other Barton grads of the late '60s did to avoid the draft.Lydia, an attractive middle-aged staff member, holds the promise of a love interest for Paul, only to show how difficult it is for social exiles to enter the romantic mainstream.The Holdovers is a small gem of a move that will immediately remind buffs about Hal Ashby comedies of the same era like Harold & Maude, where character development is paramount and detachment from the mainstream is required to look at humanity clearly with its foibles and endearments.The Holdovers is a movie everyone can enjoy with endearing characters who share with us our moments about loneliness peppered with the possibilities of love and happiness.""Do you think I want to be babysitting you? No. I was praying your mother would pick up the phone, or your father would arrive in a helicopter or a flying saucer...."" Paul Hunham."
"The Holdovers","dtswpod","6 November 2023",810,"Do you miss how they used to make films in the 1970s? Plenty of filmmakers do, except they take that nostalgia and just do watered down versions of better movies. As an example see Taxi Driver and King of Comedy then watch Joker and you'll get what I mean.Thankfully, Alexander Payne has managed to take his sentimentality and make an original film out of it. Or if The Holdovers is a pale imitation of a superior picture then the filmmaker has managed to trick me because I don't feel as if I've seen this movie before but done better.Now to be clear, there aren't things you've never seen before in the movie. I mean, you know the characters are going to bond at some point. And people will grow to care about each other. That's a given. How we get there, however, is what makes the film seem fresh and entertaining and ever bit as good as any flick made back in the day.I hope more people see it."
"The Holdovers","tdwillis-26273","7 December 2023",810,"Finally......a GOOD movie. The story/script, although not a breakthrough idea, was heartfelt,full and real.The settings were also real and gorgeous (not really a cgi fan)
Camera, cinematography, lighting,sound,score....every level made my eyes and ears satisfyingly full.Acting was oscarworthy across the board.Directing was brilliant.Only negative I can come up with is that the pace was a bit slow, but so much of the movie is so focused and so superbly and beautifully made I just sat back and enjoyed it.A very thoughtful substantial and beautiful movie. A rare gem in today's superficial gimmicky movie making world."
"The Holdovers","ferguson-6","8 November 2023",810,"Greetings again from the darkness. We've all had that teacher. You know, the one with an evil streak who just seemed to thrive on making students miserable. Throw in a staff and administrators who feel the same way, and the casting choice for the teacher becomes obvious. Enter the always great and perfectly curmudgeonly Paul Giamatti. This is the first time Giamatti has worked with two-time Oscar winner Alexander Payne since their brilliant SIDEWAYS (2004), and it's clear these two share a wavelength for comedy and drama, even in throwback form.Paul Hunham (Giamatti) is a long-time professor at Barton Academy, an all-boys private prep school located in the snowy northeast. It's December 1970, and an early scene exemplifies how he relishes the failing grades he bestows upon desperate students so afraid to disappoint their rich parents. In the final class before the holiday break, the student-teacher banter doesn't go so well for the boys, and they head to break with an extra workload. Hunham is easily manipulated into babysitting the titular holdovers - students stuck at school over the break, while most others spend time with family, often on exotic trips.Initially there are five students, but after a certain development, what remains is Hunham, smart but troubled Angus Tully (first timer Dominic Sessa) and the school's head cook, Mary Lamb (a divine Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019). Hunham is perpetually annoyed and has a weakness for booze. Angus is frustrated that his mother left him at school so she could travel with her new husband, and Mary is grieving over her son who was killed in Vietnam. Watching these three struggle to bond is a case study in psychology, yet of course we know they will ultimately form a family of misfits, depending on each other to offset the loneliness.The genius tagline for the film is ""Discomfort and Joy"", and initially the first overshadows the latter. Isolated from the world in their own way, the three characters begin to influence each other, showing broken/wounded people need and deserve love and friendship as much as anyone else. ""Entre nous"" (just between us) becomes a kind of calling card for this trio, and a Christmas party thrown by an eternally optimistic staffer (Carrie Preston) is a turning point.Giamatti is master of this material and only goes over the top a time or two. It's painful and humorous each time he is so anxious to infuse his breadth of ancient civilization facts into even the most mundane conversations. Newcomer Sessa possesses star potential and nails a complex first role. Da'Vine Joy Randolph's Mary is the heart of the film, doling out advice to Hunham and comfort to Angus. Depression is a vein running through these characters and it's acknowledged, though not the focus.This is Alexander Payne's first film since the disappointing DOWNSIZING (2017), but his brilliance has been proven in ABOUT SCHMIDT (2002), SIDEWAYS (2004), THE DESCENDANTS (2011), and NEBRASKA (2013). This time he's working from a screenplay by successful TV writer, David Hemingson, and though there is never much suspense about where the story or characters are headed, we enjoy the ride immensely. Cinematography from Eigil Byrld (IN BRUGES, 2008), perfectly complements the emotions (shot on digital, graininess added in post), and the soundtrack is period-specific, including the great Cat Stevens. Pay attention to the retro opening credits and logos, and enjoy a smart and funny film (an Alexander Payne trademark).Opening in theaters November 10, 2023."
"The Holdovers","akcenat","1 January 2024",810,"""The Holdovers"" is a captivating blend of comedy and drama that beautifully explores the complexities of human relationships.Story is about a grumpy instructor (Paul Giamatti) at a New England prep school who forms an unexpected bond with a troubled student during the Christmas break. Because it is set in the 1970s, the film in a way is a nostalgic journey back in time, but with a narrative that is both engaging and thought-provoking.The performances are exceptional, with Giamatti delivering a compelling portrayal of a man grappling with his own loneliness and the challenges of mentorship. The film's narrative is richly layered, exploring themes of loneliness, friendship, and personal growth. It's a story that resonates, offering a poignant reflection on the human condition. The film's setting in the 1970s adds a layer of nostalgia, further enhancing the emotional depth of the narrative. Despite its lengthy runtime, ""The Holdovers"" mostly maintains a steady pace, balancing its dramatic elements with moments of humor and warmth. The main plus of the movie is its dialogue-driven approach that adds to its charm, creating a sense of authenticity and depth in its character interactions.Overall, this is a film that leaves a lasting impression, offering a thoughtful exploration of human relationships set against the backdrop of a bygone era. With its exceptional performances and engaging narrative, I'm giving it an 8 out of 10 rating. It's a must-watch for those seeking a film that combines drama, comedy, and a touch of nostalgia."
"The Holdovers","Quinoa1984","30 October 2023",1010,"The Holdovers is, for all of the character dynamics and dysfunction and depression and other things we find out about the leads, mostly with Mr. Hunham and Angus and how their characters over these couple of weeks turn away from the ""Barton"" way of not telling lies (because, well, sometimes context and the moment matter for telling a lie that won't really hurt, maybe), a strangely comforting film to watch. Not for all of that exactly, though what we understand slowly but surely is this is all material for comedy and tragedy in equal measure, but because of the feeling that we get with a filmmaker who is so primed and confident with material that you don't feel like it can go wrong.What is more impressive is that, as enjoyable as the first half is, it is in the ""I like this"" mode as we are introduced to this world and Hunham and Angus and Mary, but it doesn't feel so special. But I should have known Payne and writer David Hemingson were laying down the necessary groundwork for what comes the moment a) the majority of the other supporting characters leave for reasons I don't have to mention here, and b) then the characters go outside the Barton campus grounds on a holiday party and then a ""field trip"" to Boston, you get the sense moment by moment and interaction by interaction it is so sharp and cutting and wise, and one scene in particular makes the jump into ""oh, OK, this is taking off into another level of personal pain and about familial expectations and what will come with in a life measuring up to others - and why that is wrong - and... yeah, it's great"" territory.In other words, it's the kind of film I want to watch again right away simply because now that I know a little more about the characters, I'll want to experience all of the extra textures (its 1970 down to the wood paneling and the car seats), and dig a little more into those absolutely wonderful natural restrained and complete performances - we take Giamatti for granted sometimes and this is a character he should be proud of to craft, lazy-ass eyes and all; Sessa's first role and he is an immediate star; I can't be more sure of anything for the next Oscar's that, if Randolph is nominated, she will win, if nothing else for everything she does at the Christmas party scenes, and a moment looking over some objects in a room later on is so moving - and my comfort is in seeing Payne clearly loving directing this intimate character study where he can show what a comedically observant, quick witted, and heartbreaking story this all is.It's one of the best Christmas movies in several years, embodying many themes and ideals that fit like a 70s wool sweater, and I'm sure the first thing Payne must have thought after reading the script was ""whoa. This is gonna be the best Hal Ashby or Bob Rafelson movie never made... is 'The Last Holdover' too on the nose?"" Even Hunham would give this... a B+ probably (did he ever give As? Shrug)."
"The Holdovers","jjgonzalez-06426","31 October 2023",910,"Quite possibly one of the best Christmas films ever? I first saw Payne & Giamatti's previous film together, ""Sideways"" during my screenwriting training class, and it is one that I would think of for a while. Their new film, ""The Holdovers"", is hilarious, beautifully shot and acted, heartwarming, and has a great sense of grief and joy meshed together. Definitely leaning towards Randolph for Best Supporting Actress; her performance BLEW me away.Overall, I love these films. Light-hearted & comedic while also have a sense of darkness and a lot of heavy emotion to it. Definitely is one of the most heartfelt films of the year."
"The Holdovers","paul-allaer","20 November 2023",810,"As ""The Holdovers"" (2023 release; 133 min.) opens, it's 1970 and we are at the Barton HS boarding school in New England as the Fall semester wraps up. Paul Hunham, a teacher of classical studies and a curmudgeon, gets summoned by the head of school, and is told he will take charge of the 4 or 5 ""holdovers"", students who for one reason or another, cannot go home and need to stay at the boarding school for the entire Christmas break... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest from director Alexander Payne (""Sideways"", ""The Descendants""). Here he brings to the big screen what life is like in Fall of 1970 among a group of privileged HS students along with their testy classics teacher and a Black woman who runs the kitchen. On the surface of it all, this looks to be a terrible combination, but as the movie plays out, more and more is revealed. The movie is plot-heavy and I shan't say another word on that. Paul Giamatti, a regular of Payne's prior movie work, brings what I feel is one of his strongest movie roles ever. Da'Vine Joy Randolph is outstanding as the Black kitchen supervisor with a heavy heart. Dominic Sessa is frankly too old (33 in real life) to play the rebellious HS student Angus (17 in the movie), I mean, it's really really obvious. That said, Payne just hits all the right notes in this film, and this resonated with me on so many levels. Despite the serious undertones, there are quite a few funny moments in the movie as well.""The Holdovers"" premiered a few months ago at the Telluride film festival to immediate and widespread critical acclaim. There is good reason why this is currently rated 87% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. The movie opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati the weekend before last. The early Sunday evening screening where I saw this at was attended so-so (about 12-15 people). If you are in the mood for a top-notch comedy drama, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion."
"The Holdovers","imseeg","14 December 2023",610,"I am big fan of director Alexander Payne (The Descendants, Sideways) and of actor Paul Giamatti in particular. Both have teamed up before with marvellous results, but this movie has got 1 problem that made me only rate it with 6 stars though:The bad:the middle part of this story stretches out too long, with several quite tedious scenes, which could have easily been cut out of it without hurting the storyline. I started watching at my watch half way through several times because of this lack of spark and punch. Such a pity!Fortunately this movie picked up momentum again towards the warmhearted Christmas spirited final, but I still will only award this movie with 6 stars (instead of 7) because I got bored at many moments during the somewhat tedious and long middle part.The story: It's about a young student and his teacher, who both are lonely souls and although they cant stand each other at first, eventually slowly do bond with each other during a Christmas holiday. Acting by Paul Giamatti is masterful (as always), BUT some of the other actors fail to impress me.Not the best of director Alexander Payne's work, but definitely still worth a watch, because it left me in my seat with a smile on my face and a feel good Christmas spirit of caring for one another!"
"The Holdovers","cparousis-30615","1 January 2024",1010,"Sad, poignant, funny, and beautiful are words that best describe this film. If this film doesn't make you feel sone kind of emotion, you are absolutely heartless. You love these characters. You feel for them on every single level. The film itself feels like a film from the 70s. The twists and turns the film takes are wonderful and heartwarming/heartbreaking. Paul Giamatti is excellent as always. This is Dominic Sessa's first film and he does an outstanding job. No crazy special effects or bloated explosions. Just great filmmaking. It's streaming on Peacock. An absolute holiday must. Take the time to watch it. You'll love it."
"The Holdovers","arfdawg-1","26 December 2023",510,"Lots of great reviews here. Many people who have seen Sideways seem to be excited that Giamatti has re-teamed with Payne the director.Of course, the film is in no way related to the other movie, except that both were involved and that Sideways has quite a cult following.Unfortunately this is not my type of movie. I'm not saying it's bad. And I'm not saying anything bad about the people who seem to love it. It's just not for me.It's a character driven movie, which is fine, except I didnt bond with any of the characters. And I found the choice of musical tunes throughout to be annoying at best.So if you like drawn out period piece character driven flicks, you may like this one. I didn't love it, but I could see how some might, hence the ""5"" rating."
"The Holdovers","kevin_robbins","31 December 2023",910,"My wife and I watched The Holdovers (2023) on Peacock last night. The storyline unfolds at a boarding school in Massachusetts during holiday vacation, focusing on the kids with nowhere to go for the holidays and the staff assigned to care for them, who happen to be facing a similar issue. Together, they work to uncover inner demons and find a way to release them, allowing everyone to truly enjoy the holiday season.Directed by Alexander Payne (Sideways), the film stars Paul Giamatti (American Splendor), Da'Vine Joy Randolph (Dolemite is my Name), Dominic Sessa, and Carrie Preston (Claws).This is an exceptionally unique holiday film, offering intriguing settings, characters, and circumstances. All facets are fascinating and worthwhile, with outstanding writing that establishes the storyline and various subplots effectively. The dialogue is absolutely superb, featuring a well-balanced blend of raw emotion, character development, and comedy. The eyebrow-raising conclusion is perfect for the characters' concluding direction.In conclusion, The Holdovers is a unique and captivating character piece that's an absolute must-see. I would score this a 9/10 and strongly recommend it."
"The Holdovers","euroGary","19 October 2023",1010,"One does not expect a Christmas film to be challenging, and this one certainly isn't. But it is a lot of fun.A boys' boarding school empties of almost all staff and pupils for the 1970/1 Festive Season. Left behind are Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti), the unpopular history teacher who has to keep an eye on the school; Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa), a teenaged pupil whose mother does not want him on her honeymoon; and Mary Lamb (the impressively-named Da'Vine Joy Randolph), the school cook who is facing her first Christmas alone since her son died on military service. As these three lonely souls come together, there are tantrums, emotional revelations, the revealing of long-hidden secrets, a noble sacrifice... the usual stuff.Also the usual stuff are the characters: Paul is cynical and frustrated; Angus is ironic and insecure; and as Mary is overweight and black, she of course has to be sassy.But while in some films such predictability would be annoying, it works here. Within the limits of their somewhat two-dimensional personalities, the characters are well-written - even Angus' tantrums do not seem unreasonable. Plus, there are some great gags (""You hit him? You mean you punched him out?"" ""No, I hit him with a car..."") And I will not be the only viewer who finishes the film with a lump in his throat.Great fun. I can easily see myself buying the DVD and watching this for many Christmases to come..."
"The Holdovers","cherold","31 December 2023",810,"This movie is about a handful of entitled boys who regretfully must stay behind during the Christmas break at their private school and the teacher and cook there to oversee them.It's a funny and affecting movie with excellent performances from the leads, especially Paul giamatti as the prickly teacher.It's a Christmas movie of sorts, since it does take place at Christmas, but it's really more of an anytime of the year film in which you get to see people have adventures and fight and grow and that sort of thing.It's very well filmed, it's very entertaining, and I would recommend you watch it."
"The Holdovers","bastille-852-731547","29 October 2023",610,"Set in December 1970, ""The Holdovers"" follows a small group of students who have to stay on campus over the Christmas break at Barton Academy (a prestigious boarding school in Massachusetts,) alongside a curmudgeonly ancient history teacher (Paul Giamatti.) That sounds like a potentially amusing premise for a breezy comedy-drama, especially when Alexander Payne is directing. Having greatly enjoyed and admired several of Payne's previous films such as ""Sideways,"" ""The Descendants,"" and ""Nebraska,"" I was looking forward to this film. Overall, I found it to be simply fine and not up to par with the level of quality of most of Payne's films. There's nothing too wrong with it by any stretch of the imagination, but it's often generic and forgettable compared to Payne's other films.An indie dramedy like this film would generally be expected to be defined by being character- and writing-driven. Unfortunately, neither the characters nor the writing here are especially unique enough to structure a compelling plot around. Paul (Giamatti's character) is very generic, as is the rebellious student Angus, whose relationship with Paul is a pivotal part of the film. On a better note, Da'Vine Joy Randolph gives a strong and impactful performance as Mary, a cafeteria worker dealing with bereavement; her character is interestingly more dynamic and multi-dimensional than either Paul or Angus. The writing and humor is less unique, funny, or engaging than many of Payne's films, as the attempts at plot devices, character development, and humor often boil down to insult comedy between Paul and Angus--which, ultimately, wears out its welcome a bit, and actually causes a bit of collateral damage in making the film's tone and story feel less sincere. Regardless of the sincerity of the story, another thing that is clear here is that there needed to be a stronger and less predictable core to the plot in order for the film to remain engaging for its 133-minute runtime.The film's retro, 1970s-aesthetic is commendable and helps contribute to the atmosphere of the film, and there still are some sporadic sweet moments of Paul and Mary hanging out around the television and a few decent jokes here and there. So ""The Holdovers"" is a fine enough film, but it won't be a new holiday classic for me. 6/10."
"The Holdovers","RahulM007","31 October 2023",1010,"""Penis cancer in human form.""Alexander Payne's ""The Holdovers"" is a laugh-out-loud comedy strengthened by Paul Giamatti and Dominic Sessa's magnetic performances and their incredible chemistry together. I am in awe by the film's brilliant and inventive screenplay, 70s-style cinematography, slick editing, and great production design. I could watch Paul and Angus bicker for another two hours. Throughout the film, the humour gets more interwoven leading to a crescendo of hilarity. ""The Holdovers"" offers the perfect blend of humor and pathos.*That waitress was so rude for refusing to accept their order of cherries jubilee. She is a fascist and a ""penis cancer in human form"".*The film reminded me of Peter Weir's ""Dead Poets Society"", Milos Forman's ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", and John Hughes' ""The Breakfast Club"" (kind of).Final verdict: 10/10."
"The Holdovers","Avwillfan89","29 November 2023",910,"Finally, Alexander Payne has made a worthy follow up to his (in my opinion at least) masterpiece Sideways.I really related so much to all three of the main characters, who all come from different backgrounds. Paul Giamatti, brilliant in almost anything he does, plays a grumpy, alcoholic, sour professor who does not suffer fools and doesn't cut his privileged students any slack. Dominic Sessa is troubled teen with a dysfunctional family and mental issues. D'Avine Joy Randolf is a grieving mother stuck in a job wanting to make ends meet for her family, by her choice.This movie has great character development, a wholesome story with flawed yet lovable characters you can root for and terrific, funny dialogue. Simple, yet perfect. 9 out of 10."
"The Holdovers","frankde-jong","27 December 2023",910,"I had a lot of associations when I started watching ""The holdovers"".Kids stuck in a school during the Christmas vacation, is that not a little bit like ""The breakfast club"" (1985, John Hughes)? No, because most of the kids go away early in the film and we are left with just one pupil (Angus Tully played by Dominic Sessa) and a teacher (Paul Hunham played by Paul Giamatti).Paul Hunham teaches ancient languages and culture. Does that sounds like the Donna Tartt novel ""The secret history"" (1992)? No, in that novel the pupils are inspired by their teacher. In ""The holdovers"" the teacher is hated.One association that I did not have at all prior to watching the movie may be the most accurate: ""Scent of a woman"" (1992, Martin Brest). Also in this film a high school pupil on an expensive boarding school and a grumpy old man are condemned to each other.Best of all however we can see ""The holdovers"" as the comeback of Alexander Payne after his failed film ""Downsizing"" (2017). The film is situated in 1970 and has a very 70's look and feel, down to the aspect ratio then used. The film also contains very beautiful images of Norteast American landscapes.First of all however the film is about its three main characters. Apart from the two already introduced we have the chief cook of the boarding school Mary Lamb (Da'Vine Joy Randolph). These three people form a sort of substitute family that has to spend the Christmas season together. Each of them has his/her problems but during the film they grow closer to each other, or at least learn to understand each other better.Being a Christmas movie you expect a happy ending and somewhere in the middle of the film this happy ending seems to consist of all the members of the proxy family being on their way towards an unexpected romance. The greatness of the film is that these romances do not materialize fully. The message of the film seems to be that gaining better understanding is a happy enough ending.By the way the film does not shy away from some social criticism. The character of Paul Hunham is meant to be grumpy at first, but to me he was instantly sympathetic when he made the headmaster of the boarding school very clear that in his class wealthy parents could not buy good grades for their sons. Later he says to his pupils (at that stage of the film there are still a couple of them) that they ought to be aware of their privileged status. ""You go to Harvard, poorer boys go to Vietnam"". The Vietnam war plays an important role in the background anyway. The son of the chief cook has died in Vietnam and while visiting a bar in the village nearby the boarding school there is a local boy that lost one of his hands in Vietnam.All in all ""The holdovers"" is a very convincing comeback of Alexander Payne. He made an instant Christmas classic!"
"The Holdovers","210west","14 January 2024",410,"Alexander Payne's 1999 comedy ""Election,"" set in a Midwestern high school, was brilliant, sometimes painful, sometimes hilarious. Best of all (I say this as a onetime high school teacher), it felt refreshingly authentic.""The Holdovers"" is quite the opposite: contrived, predictable, and intended to teach -- you guessed it -- a little lesson in compassion. An hour into it, I realized that it hadn't yet contained a single moment that seemed genuine, much less surprising. Every line of dialogue sounds phony. Characters speak in little announcements, spelling things out for us. Some of the characters -- a couple of menacing townies, for example -- are mere cartoons.Giamatti's protagonist is a wholly artificial creation, designed as if in a screenwriting course to follow the approved character arc -- initially stuffy and unsympathetic to the point of caricature, ultimately vulnerable. Ironically, an early scene between him and the school's headmaster violates what's sometimes regarded as a screenwriting rule: Do NOT, even in the interest of exposition, have people telling each other what they already know. (The by-the-numbers triteness of that conversation -- meant to show us that the instructor is uncompromising and pedantic but possesses old-fashioned integrity, blah blah blah -- put me off from the start.) The scenes between Giamatti and the school's cook -- in which, with the audience in mind, the two provide personal backstories and reveal their inner selves -- are painfully heavy-handed and at times so gooey that I felt sorry for the actress: ""You can't even dream a whole dream, can you?"" she is made to say at one point. ""What are you afraid of?""Yes, I know, everybody seems to love the movie. I could barely stomach it. But do check out ""Election."""
"The Holdovers","bdesdes","30 October 2023",810,"Very enjoyable film with outstanding performances and a wonderful warm vibe accompanied by the Christmas season. It's funny at times, sad at times, and feel-good. It's a story that almost all can relate to and will really touch your heart. It deals with so many themes, but mainly grief, the past, family, and what makes a person who they are. It's also very original and has a great script, cinematography, and soundtrack. I would highly advise to see it in the theaters as well as you really get the 70's vibe and deep moment on the big screen. There aren't many negatives to this film and I would recommend it to most people."
"The Holdovers","aharmas","29 October 2023",1010,"Here is a film that feels and looks like something out of the early seventies. The Holdovers is a strong and warm-hearted piece that gives actors roles with powerful lines, without any reliance on flashy editing and being overwhelmed by special effects.The story is simple three people get stuck for the Christmas holidays in a boarding school. It's cold, lonely, and boring for the parties involved. The adults drink to cope with whatever pressures they live with. The young man resorts to bad behavior and altercations with the teacher in charge.Through the vacation period these people will get to interact and get to know each other, something that will prove to a challenge to say the least. As the story evolves, we get to understand what has made the people who they are. We get to feel their pain and frustration through the very insightful writing of the director.It's a strong film with superb acting by the main leads. They have great chemistry together.Most outstanding is Paul Giamatti who plays the tormented and defensive man with relish and speaks volumes with his eyes.Hope the academy honors his performance as the best the year because no one else so far is coming close."
"The Holdovers","darkreignn","29 October 2023",910,"Let's just get this out of the way now - when it comes to writing this review, I'm probably a little bit biased (and a little bit drunk, currently, but that's besides the point). You see, I have an affinity for indie coming of age movies, and ""The Holdovers"" is basically an indie coming of age film, so it may - or may not - come as a surprise to you that I absolutely adored this picture. So, with that little preface out of the way, it's time for me to gush over this movie.Starring none other than Paul Giamatti as Paul Hunham, Giamatti plays a professor at an all boys boarding school where, over Christmas break, he has the misfortune of looking over a group of boys, one of whom is named Angus, played by Dominic Sessa. After a rocky start, where Paul clearly doesn't get along with any of the boys, making his disdain clear and evident, he eventually finds himself alone with Angus - as well as with the school's cook, Mary Lamb, played by Da'Vine Joy Randolph - in an unexpected chain of events. What occurs after is a slice-of-life style piece of cinema that allows broken people to find comfort in each other's company.""The Holdovers"" is, without a doubt, one of my favorite movies of 2023, as well as probably one of the best movies of the year, as well. This Christmas-themed gem doesn't hold back on the drama, delivering a thoughtful blend of comedy, coming-of-age storytelling, and a touch of romance - all wrapped around a very raw, human plot-line that virtually everyone can relate to. I'm no spring chicken myself, but I found myself deeply connected to both main characters - one who is older and basically dejected with life as he knows it, and one who is younger but who feels lost, aimless, and disconnected from both family and friends. And admittedly, not everyone will have a direct parallel to these experiences, but even if you don't, you're in for a story that's bound to tug at your heartstrings... and make you laugh out loud in the process.This is a high-quality movie - from the impeccable acting to the beautiful on-location cinematography to the relatable, thought-provoking plot, every element is executed with pinpoint precision and finesse; it's a testament to the art of storytelling on the silver screen. Director Alexander Payne knows how to create an artful film, and ""The Holdovers"" is no exception. It's at once indie and art-house while simultaneously being mainstream and easily accessible; in short, it's a film for everyone that actually feels like a genuine crowdpleaser instead of a pandering mess.I'm having a difficult time describing what I liked about this movie, and the reason is because I liked almost everything about this movie. So why the 9 out of 10 rating instead of the perfect 10? Literally the only thing that's holding me back is because I would've liked a touch more romance; yes, there was romance here, but a bit more would've pushed me over the edge into 10 out of 10 territory. Besides that, this is basically a perfect film, one that I loved, and one that has become one of my favorite movies of the year, if not of all time. I am genuinely looking forward to rewatching this, and I can't wait until it becomes closer to Christmas so I can view this on my own TV, cuddled under blankets, with a glass of whiskey, and bask in the absolute heartwarming experience that is ""The Holdovers."" My recommendation: Do yourself a favor and watch this as soon as you can - you won't regret it."
"The Holdovers","evanston_dad","20 November 2023",1010,"Mid-way through ""The Holdovers,"" I started openly weeping in the movie theater, and I pretty much kept it up on and off for the rest of the movie. Sometimes, there wasn't even anything obviously sad or moving happening in the scene, and I still couldn't stop. I think it's because this movie is so kind, and kindness is a rare commodity these days. It's sad to think that a movie about characters learning to have compassion for each other and for the hardships they've been through should feel like such a rare beast, but here we are.This is Alexander Payne firing on all cylinders as a director, and though he didn't write this movie, it feels like he could have. It's an obvious throwback to the kinds of movies Hal Ashby made throughout the 1970s and is touching in exactly the same way ""Harold and Maude"" was. It's also a master class in acting from the three principal characters played by Paul Giamatti, Dominic Sessa, and Da 'Vine Joy Randolph, and I hope all three of them, and the movie overall, is remembered come Oscar time.This will easily make my top ten list for the year.Grade: A+"
"The Holdovers","Xstal","28 November 2023",810,"Now here's a film with a life affirming theme, that should encourage most viewers to think of their dreams, and cascade away all their cloaks, inhibitions, and open fresh doors to their heart's intuitions; as a teacher whose life is as stale as dead fish, whose life is the opposite of happy and bliss, meets a boy who's ignored by all those he holds dear, and a friendship is formed that is warm and sincere; it's a subtle reflection of how we get trapped, by tradition and habits and past circumstance, where surroundings like prisons can temper our thinking, to distil all our spirit, to bottles for drinking; so embrace all the chances when they come along, break out of that mould and sing your own song, open your eyes to the paths unexplored, take a stand and stand tall, and stop being ignored."
"The Holdovers","steiner-sam","10 November 2023",910,"It's a comedy-drama set from December 16, 1970, to the first week of January 1971 in an exclusive boy's boarding school in New England and Boston, Massachusetts. It follows the experiences of the ""holdovers,"" that is, the students who cannot go home over the Christmas holidays and the two Barton staff left to supervise them during the holidays.There are five holdovers: Teddy Kountze (Brady Hepner), Jason Smith (Michael Provost), and Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa) are upper-class wealthy WASP students. Alex Ollerman (Ian Dolley) is a younger Mormon student whose parents are on a mission in South America. Ye-Joon Park (Jim Kaplan) is from South Korea.Left to supervise is Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti), an unmarried ancient history teacher who was once a student at Barton and has taught there all his career. He's a demanding curmudgeon who almost everyone dislikes. African American Mary Lamb (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), the head cook, is also present; her son, a Barton grad, has just been killed in Vietnam.The film follows the shared experiences of the holdovers, though four students leave after a week when a wealthy father takes them for a ski holiday. Paul cannot contact Angus's parents, so he must stay with Paul and Mary at Barton. We also meet the school's headmaster, Hardy Woodrup (Andrew Garman), his administrative assistant, Lydia Crane (Carrie Preston), and janitor Danny (Naheem Garcia).""The Holdovers"" is a delightful comedy leavened with wisdom as we learn the dark secrets that have shaped Paul Hunham and Angus Tully. Giamatti, Sessa, and Randolph are all excellent. The script unfolds the twists and turns superbly. ""The Holdovers"" is a great Christmas movie."
"The Holdovers","JohnDeSando","16 November 2023",NA,"""I find the world a bitter and complicated place. And it seems to feel the same way about me."" Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti)Teaching privileged boys at an elite new England prep school called Barton (think for example, Philips Exeter), might be the pinnacle of an academic's career. But not Paul Hunham in The Holdovers, an elite movie itself of the year.Paul should be teaching classics at an ivy school, not teaching entitled ""vermin,"" among the many sobriquets he tosses around about the fortunate young men to experience his brand of grumpy intellectualism and misanthropy. He prepares them for a world that won't always be coddling and protecting them as their family wealth so naturally does in their early years.Director Alexander Payne worked with Giamatti in Sideways, so he is prepared to have another winning cynical character who is endearing while distanced by negative temperament from normally positive fellow humans (Paul's last name, Hunham, suggests a distant connection with the better angels of humanity).As Paul accepts the assignment to supervise holdovers (exiled to Christmas vacation in the absence of parents or guardians), the number whittles down to just Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa, reminiscent of young, Timothy Chalamet and Adam Driver), who shares Paul's dark attitudes and, with the sharp writing of David Hemingson, some witty dialogue- e.g., about Paul he says, ""I thought all of the Nazis had left for Argentina.""Although, as in likeminded dramas such as Dead Poet's Society or Goodbye, Mr. Chips, the principals are destined to be transformed into more humane characters, Holdovers continues, even in its denouement, to accentuate the unsunny side of life for Paul and Tully, whose fortunes are still compromised by cold-hearted parents and administrators. The chilly world, however, is warmed on these lovely, snowbound days, by women, viz., the cook, Mary (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) and administrator Lydia (Carrie Preston).Mary good-naturedly deals with the death of her son, Curtis, a Barton grad who had to join the military because he did not have the resources as other Barton grads of the late '60s did to avoid the draft.Lydia, an attractive middle-aged staff member, holds the promise of a love interest for Paul, only to show how difficult it is for social exiles to enter the romantic mainstream.The Holdovers is a small gem of a move that will immediately remind buffs about Hal Ashby comedies of the same era like Harold & Maude, where character development is paramount and detachment from the mainstream is required to look at humanity clearly with its foibles and endearments.The Holdovers is a movie everyone can enjoy with endearing characters who share with us our moments about loneliness peppered with the possibilities of love and happiness.""Do you think I want to be babysitting you? No. I was praying your mother would pick up the phone, or your father would arrive in a helicopter or a flying saucer...."" Paul Hunham."
"The Holdovers","dtswpod","6 November 2023",810,"Do you miss how they used to make films in the 1970s? Plenty of filmmakers do, except they take that nostalgia and just do watered down versions of better movies. As an example see Taxi Driver and King of Comedy then watch Joker and you'll get what I mean.Thankfully, Alexander Payne has managed to take his sentimentality and make an original film out of it. Or if The Holdovers is a pale imitation of a superior picture then the filmmaker has managed to trick me because I don't feel as if I've seen this movie before but done better.Now to be clear, there aren't things you've never seen before in the movie. I mean, you know the characters are going to bond at some point. And people will grow to care about each other. That's a given. How we get there, however, is what makes the film seem fresh and entertaining and ever bit as good as any flick made back in the day.I hope more people see it."

"The Holdovers","ferguson-6","8 November 2023",810,"Greetings again from the darkness. We've all had that teacher. You know, the one with an evil streak who just seemed to thrive on making students miserable. Throw in a staff and administrators who feel the same way, and the casting choice for the teacher becomes obvious. Enter the always great and perfectly curmudgeonly Paul Giamatti. This is the first time Giamatti has worked with two-time Oscar winner Alexander Payne since their brilliant SIDEWAYS (2004), and it's clear these two share a wavelength for comedy and drama, even in throwback form.Paul Hunham (Giamatti) is a long-time professor at Barton Academy, an all-boys private prep school located in the snowy northeast. It's December 1970, and an early scene exemplifies how he relishes the failing grades he bestows upon desperate students so afraid to disappoint their rich parents. In the final class before the holiday break, the student-teacher banter doesn't go so well for the boys, and they head to break with an extra workload. Hunham is easily manipulated into babysitting the titular holdovers - students stuck at school over the break, while most others spend time with family, often on exotic trips.Initially there are five students, but after a certain development, what remains is Hunham, smart but troubled Angus Tully (first timer Dominic Sessa) and the school's head cook, Mary Lamb (a divine Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019). Hunham is perpetually annoyed and has a weakness for booze. Angus is frustrated that his mother left him at school so she could travel with her new husband, and Mary is grieving over her son who was killed in Vietnam. Watching these three struggle to bond is a case study in psychology, yet of course we know they will ultimately form a family of misfits, depending on each other to offset the loneliness.The genius tagline for the film is ""Discomfort and Joy"", and initially the first overshadows the latter. Isolated from the world in their own way, the three characters begin to influence each other, showing broken/wounded people need and deserve love and friendship as much as anyone else. ""Entre nous"" (just between us) becomes a kind of calling card for this trio, and a Christmas party thrown by an eternally optimistic staffer (Carrie Preston) is a turning point.Giamatti is master of this material and only goes over the top a time or two. It's painful and humorous each time he is so anxious to infuse his breadth of ancient civilization facts into even the most mundane conversations. Newcomer Sessa possesses star potential and nails a complex first role. Da'Vine Joy Randolph's Mary is the heart of the film, doling out advice to Hunham and comfort to Angus. Depression is a vein running through these characters and it's acknowledged, though not the focus.This is Alexander Payne's first film since the disappointing DOWNSIZING (2017), but his brilliance has been proven in ABOUT SCHMIDT (2002), SIDEWAYS (2004), THE DESCENDANTS (2011), and NEBRASKA (2013). This time he's working from a screenplay by successful TV writer, David Hemingson, and though there is never much suspense about where the story or characters are headed, we enjoy the ride immensely. Cinematography from Eigil Byrld (IN BRUGES, 2008), perfectly complements the emotions (shot on digital, graininess added in post), and the soundtrack is period-specific, including the great Cat Stevens. Pay attention to the retro opening credits and logos, and enjoy a smart and funny film (an Alexander Payne trademark).Opening in theaters November 10, 2023."
"The Holdovers","akcenat","1 January 2024",810,"""The Holdovers"" is a captivating blend of comedy and drama that beautifully explores the complexities of human relationships.Story is about a grumpy instructor (Paul Giamatti) at a New England prep school who forms an unexpected bond with a troubled student during the Christmas break. Because it is set in the 1970s, the film in a way is a nostalgic journey back in time, but with a narrative that is both engaging and thought-provoking.The performances are exceptional, with Giamatti delivering a compelling portrayal of a man grappling with his own loneliness and the challenges of mentorship. The film's narrative is richly layered, exploring themes of loneliness, friendship, and personal growth. It's a story that resonates, offering a poignant reflection on the human condition. The film's setting in the 1970s adds a layer of nostalgia, further enhancing the emotional depth of the narrative. Despite its lengthy runtime, ""The Holdovers"" mostly maintains a steady pace, balancing its dramatic elements with moments of humor and warmth. The main plus of the movie is its dialogue-driven approach that adds to its charm, creating a sense of authenticity and depth in its character interactions.Overall, this is a film that leaves a lasting impression, offering a thoughtful exploration of human relationships set against the backdrop of a bygone era. With its exceptional performances and engaging narrative, I'm giving it an 8 out of 10 rating. It's a must-watch for those seeking a film that combines drama, comedy, and a touch of nostalgia."
"The Holdovers","Quinoa1984","30 October 2023",1010,"The Holdovers is, for all of the character dynamics and dysfunction and depression and other things we find out about the leads, mostly with Mr. Hunham and Angus and how their characters over these couple of weeks turn away from the ""Barton"" way of not telling lies (because, well, sometimes context and the moment matter for telling a lie that won't really hurt, maybe), a strangely comforting film to watch. Not for all of that exactly, though what we understand slowly but surely is this is all material for comedy and tragedy in equal measure, but because of the feeling that we get with a filmmaker who is so primed and confident with material that you don't feel like it can go wrong.What is more impressive is that, as enjoyable as the first half is, it is in the ""I like this"" mode as we are introduced to this world and Hunham and Angus and Mary, but it doesn't feel so special. But I should have known Payne and writer David Hemingson were laying down the necessary groundwork for what comes the moment a) the majority of the other supporting characters leave for reasons I don't have to mention here, and b) then the characters go outside the Barton campus grounds on a holiday party and then a ""field trip"" to Boston, you get the sense moment by moment and interaction by interaction it is so sharp and cutting and wise, and one scene in particular makes the jump into ""oh, OK, this is taking off into another level of personal pain and about familial expectations and what will come with in a life measuring up to others - and why that is wrong - and... yeah, it's great"" territory.In other words, it's the kind of film I want to watch again right away simply because now that I know a little more about the characters, I'll want to experience all of the extra textures (its 1970 down to the wood paneling and the car seats), and dig a little more into those absolutely wonderful natural restrained and complete performances - we take Giamatti for granted sometimes and this is a character he should be proud of to craft, lazy-ass eyes and all; Sessa's first role and he is an immediate star; I can't be more sure of anything for the next Oscar's that, if Randolph is nominated, she will win, if nothing else for everything she does at the Christmas party scenes, and a moment looking over some objects in a room later on is so moving - and my comfort is in seeing Payne clearly loving directing this intimate character study where he can show what a comedically observant, quick witted, and heartbreaking story this all is.It's one of the best Christmas movies in several years, embodying many themes and ideals that fit like a 70s wool sweater, and I'm sure the first thing Payne must have thought after reading the script was ""whoa. This is gonna be the best Hal Ashby or Bob Rafelson movie never made... is 'The Last Holdover' too on the nose?"" Even Hunham would give this... a B+ probably (did he ever give As? Shrug)."
"The Holdovers","jjgonzalez-06426","31 October 2023",910,"Quite possibly one of the best Christmas films ever? I first saw Payne & Giamatti's previous film together, ""Sideways"" during my screenwriting training class, and it is one that I would think of for a while. Their new film, ""The Holdovers"", is hilarious, beautifully shot and acted, heartwarming, and has a great sense of grief and joy meshed together. Definitely leaning towards Randolph for Best Supporting Actress; her performance BLEW me away.Overall, I love these films. Light-hearted & comedic while also have a sense of darkness and a lot of heavy emotion to it. Definitely is one of the most heartfelt films of the year."
"The Holdovers","paul-allaer","20 November 2023",810,"As ""The Holdovers"" (2023 release; 133 min.) opens, it's 1970 and we are at the Barton HS boarding school in New England as the Fall semester wraps up. Paul Hunham, a teacher of classical studies and a curmudgeon, gets summoned by the head of school, and is told he will take charge of the 4 or 5 ""holdovers"", students who for one reason or another, cannot go home and need to stay at the boarding school for the entire Christmas break... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest from director Alexander Payne (""Sideways"", ""The Descendants""). Here he brings to the big screen what life is like in Fall of 1970 among a group of privileged HS students along with their testy classics teacher and a Black woman who runs the kitchen. On the surface of it all, this looks to be a terrible combination, but as the movie plays out, more and more is revealed. The movie is plot-heavy and I shan't say another word on that. Paul Giamatti, a regular of Payne's prior movie work, brings what I feel is one of his strongest movie roles ever. Da'Vine Joy Randolph is outstanding as the Black kitchen supervisor with a heavy heart. Dominic Sessa is frankly too old (33 in real life) to play the rebellious HS student Angus (17 in the movie), I mean, it's really really obvious. That said, Payne just hits all the right notes in this film, and this resonated with me on so many levels. Despite the serious undertones, there are quite a few funny moments in the movie as well.""The Holdovers"" premiered a few months ago at the Telluride film festival to immediate and widespread critical acclaim. There is good reason why this is currently rated 87% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. The movie opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati the weekend before last. The early Sunday evening screening where I saw this at was attended so-so (about 12-15 people). If you are in the mood for a top-notch comedy drama, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion."
"The Holdovers","imseeg","14 December 2023",610,"I am big fan of director Alexander Payne (The Descendants, Sideways) and of actor Paul Giamatti in particular. Both have teamed up before with marvellous results, but this movie has got 1 problem that made me only rate it with 6 stars though:The bad:the middle part of this story stretches out too long, with several quite tedious scenes, which could have easily been cut out of it without hurting the storyline. I started watching at my watch half way through several times because of this lack of spark and punch. Such a pity!Fortunately this movie picked up momentum again towards the warmhearted Christmas spirited final, but I still will only award this movie with 6 stars (instead of 7) because I got bored at many moments during the somewhat tedious and long middle part.The story: It's about a young student and his teacher, who both are lonely souls and although they cant stand each other at first, eventually slowly do bond with each other during a Christmas holiday. Acting by Paul Giamatti is masterful (as always), BUT some of the other actors fail to impress me.Not the best of director Alexander Payne's work, but definitely still worth a watch, because it left me in my seat with a smile on my face and a feel good Christmas spirit of caring for one another!"
"The Holdovers","cparousis-30615","1 January 2024",1010,"Sad, poignant, funny, and beautiful are words that best describe this film. If this film doesn't make you feel sone kind of emotion, you are absolutely heartless. You love these characters. You feel for them on every single level. The film itself feels like a film from the 70s. The twists and turns the film takes are wonderful and heartwarming/heartbreaking. Paul Giamatti is excellent as always. This is Dominic Sessa's first film and he does an outstanding job. No crazy special effects or bloated explosions. Just great filmmaking. It's streaming on Peacock. An absolute holiday must. Take the time to watch it. You'll love it."
"The Holdovers","arfdawg-1","26 December 2023",510,"Lots of great reviews here. Many people who have seen Sideways seem to be excited that Giamatti has re-teamed with Payne the director.Of course, the film is in no way related to the other movie, except that both were involved and that Sideways has quite a cult following.Unfortunately this is not my type of movie. I'm not saying it's bad. And I'm not saying anything bad about the people who seem to love it. It's just not for me.It's a character driven movie, which is fine, except I didnt bond with any of the characters. And I found the choice of musical tunes throughout to be annoying at best.So if you like drawn out period piece character driven flicks, you may like this one. I didn't love it, but I could see how some might, hence the ""5"" rating."
"The Holdovers","kevin_robbins","31 December 2023",910,"My wife and I watched The Holdovers (2023) on Peacock last night. The storyline unfolds at a boarding school in Massachusetts during holiday vacation, focusing on the kids with nowhere to go for the holidays and the staff assigned to care for them, who happen to be facing a similar issue. Together, they work to uncover inner demons and find a way to release them, allowing everyone to truly enjoy the holiday season.Directed by Alexander Payne (Sideways), the film stars Paul Giamatti (American Splendor), Da'Vine Joy Randolph (Dolemite is my Name), Dominic Sessa, and Carrie Preston (Claws).This is an exceptionally unique holiday film, offering intriguing settings, characters, and circumstances. All facets are fascinating and worthwhile, with outstanding writing that establishes the storyline and various subplots effectively. The dialogue is absolutely superb, featuring a well-balanced blend of raw emotion, character development, and comedy. The eyebrow-raising conclusion is perfect for the characters' concluding direction.In conclusion, The Holdovers is a unique and captivating character piece that's an absolute must-see. I would score this a 9/10 and strongly recommend it."
"The Holdovers","euroGary","19 October 2023",1010,"One does not expect a Christmas film to be challenging, and this one certainly isn't. But it is a lot of fun.A boys' boarding school empties of almost all staff and pupils for the 1970/1 Festive Season. Left behind are Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti), the unpopular history teacher who has to keep an eye on the school; Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa), a teenaged pupil whose mother does not want him on her honeymoon; and Mary Lamb (the impressively-named Da'Vine Joy Randolph), the school cook who is facing her first Christmas alone since her son died on military service. As these three lonely souls come together, there are tantrums, emotional revelations, the revealing of long-hidden secrets, a noble sacrifice... the usual stuff.Also the usual stuff are the characters: Paul is cynical and frustrated; Angus is ironic and insecure; and as Mary is overweight and black, she of course has to be sassy.But while in some films such predictability would be annoying, it works here. Within the limits of their somewhat two-dimensional personalities, the characters are well-written - even Angus' tantrums do not seem unreasonable. Plus, there are some great gags (""You hit him? You mean you punched him out?"" ""No, I hit him with a car..."") And I will not be the only viewer who finishes the film with a lump in his throat.Great fun. I can easily see myself buying the DVD and watching this for many Christmases to come..."
"The Holdovers","cherold","31 December 2023",810,"This movie is about a handful of entitled boys who regretfully must stay behind during the Christmas break at their private school and the teacher and cook there to oversee them.It's a funny and affecting movie with excellent performances from the leads, especially Paul giamatti as the prickly teacher.It's a Christmas movie of sorts, since it does take place at Christmas, but it's really more of an anytime of the year film in which you get to see people have adventures and fight and grow and that sort of thing.It's very well filmed, it's very entertaining, and I would recommend you watch it."
"The Holdovers","bastille-852-731547","29 October 2023",610,"Set in December 1970, ""The Holdovers"" follows a small group of students who have to stay on campus over the Christmas break at Barton Academy (a prestigious boarding school in Massachusetts,) alongside a curmudgeonly ancient history teacher (Paul Giamatti.) That sounds like a potentially amusing premise for a breezy comedy-drama, especially when Alexander Payne is directing. Having greatly enjoyed and admired several of Payne's previous films such as ""Sideways,"" ""The Descendants,"" and ""Nebraska,"" I was looking forward to this film. Overall, I found it to be simply fine and not up to par with the level of quality of most of Payne's films. There's nothing too wrong with it by any stretch of the imagination, but it's often generic and forgettable compared to Payne's other films.An indie dramedy like this film would generally be expected to be defined by being character- and writing-driven. Unfortunately, neither the characters nor the writing here are especially unique enough to structure a compelling plot around. Paul (Giamatti's character) is very generic, as is the rebellious student Angus, whose relationship with Paul is a pivotal part of the film. On a better note, Da'Vine Joy Randolph gives a strong and impactful performance as Mary, a cafeteria worker dealing with bereavement; her character is interestingly more dynamic and multi-dimensional than either Paul or Angus. The writing and humor is less unique, funny, or engaging than many of Payne's films, as the attempts at plot devices, character development, and humor often boil down to insult comedy between Paul and Angus--which, ultimately, wears out its welcome a bit, and actually causes a bit of collateral damage in making the film's tone and story feel less sincere. Regardless of the sincerity of the story, another thing that is clear here is that there needed to be a stronger and less predictable core to the plot in order for the film to remain engaging for its 133-minute runtime.The film's retro, 1970s-aesthetic is commendable and helps contribute to the atmosphere of the film, and there still are some sporadic sweet moments of Paul and Mary hanging out around the television and a few decent jokes here and there. So ""The Holdovers"" is a fine enough film, but it won't be a new holiday classic for me. 6/10."
"The Holdovers","RahulM007","31 October 2023",1010,"""Penis cancer in human form.""Alexander Payne's ""The Holdovers"" is a laugh-out-loud comedy strengthened by Paul Giamatti and Dominic Sessa's magnetic performances and their incredible chemistry together. I am in awe by the film's brilliant and inventive screenplay, 70s-style cinematography, slick editing, and great production design. I could watch Paul and Angus bicker for another two hours. Throughout the film, the humour gets more interwoven leading to a crescendo of hilarity. ""The Holdovers"" offers the perfect blend of humor and pathos.*That waitress was so rude for refusing to accept their order of cherries jubilee. She is a fascist and a ""penis cancer in human form"".*The film reminded me of Peter Weir's ""Dead Poets Society"", Milos Forman's ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", and John Hughes' ""The Breakfast Club"" (kind of).Final verdict: 10/10."
"The Holdovers","Avwillfan89","29 November 2023",910,"Finally, Alexander Payne has made a worthy follow up to his (in my opinion at least) masterpiece Sideways.I really related so much to all three of the main characters, who all come from different backgrounds. Paul Giamatti, brilliant in almost anything he does, plays a grumpy, alcoholic, sour professor who does not suffer fools and doesn't cut his privileged students any slack. Dominic Sessa is troubled teen with a dysfunctional family and mental issues. D'Avine Joy Randolf is a grieving mother stuck in a job wanting to make ends meet for her family, by her choice.This movie has great character development, a wholesome story with flawed yet lovable characters you can root for and terrific, funny dialogue. Simple, yet perfect. 9 out of 10."
"The Holdovers","frankde-jong","27 December 2023",910,"I had a lot of associations when I started watching ""The holdovers"".Kids stuck in a school during the Christmas vacation, is that not a little bit like ""The breakfast club"" (1985, John Hughes)? No, because most of the kids go away early in the film and we are left with just one pupil (Angus Tully played by Dominic Sessa) and a teacher (Paul Hunham played by Paul Giamatti).Paul Hunham teaches ancient languages and culture. Does that sounds like the Donna Tartt novel ""The secret history"" (1992)? No, in that novel the pupils are inspired by their teacher. In ""The holdovers"" the teacher is hated.One association that I did not have at all prior to watching the movie may be the most accurate: ""Scent of a woman"" (1992, Martin Brest). Also in this film a high school pupil on an expensive boarding school and a grumpy old man are condemned to each other.Best of all however we can see ""The holdovers"" as the comeback of Alexander Payne after his failed film ""Downsizing"" (2017). The film is situated in 1970 and has a very 70's look and feel, down to the aspect ratio then used. The film also contains very beautiful images of Norteast American landscapes.First of all however the film is about its three main characters. Apart from the two already introduced we have the chief cook of the boarding school Mary Lamb (Da'Vine Joy Randolph). These three people form a sort of substitute family that has to spend the Christmas season together. Each of them has his/her problems but during the film they grow closer to each other, or at least learn to understand each other better.Being a Christmas movie you expect a happy ending and somewhere in the middle of the film this happy ending seems to consist of all the members of the proxy family being on their way towards an unexpected romance. The greatness of the film is that these romances do not materialize fully. The message of the film seems to be that gaining better understanding is a happy enough ending.By the way the film does not shy away from some social criticism. The character of Paul Hunham is meant to be grumpy at first, but to me he was instantly sympathetic when he made the headmaster of the boarding school very clear that in his class wealthy parents could not buy good grades for their sons. Later he says to his pupils (at that stage of the film there are still a couple of them) that they ought to be aware of their privileged status. ""You go to Harvard, poorer boys go to Vietnam"". The Vietnam war plays an important role in the background anyway. The son of the chief cook has died in Vietnam and while visiting a bar in the village nearby the boarding school there is a local boy that lost one of his hands in Vietnam.All in all ""The holdovers"" is a very convincing comeback of Alexander Payne. He made an instant Christmas classic!"
"The Holdovers","210west","14 January 2024",410,"Alexander Payne's 1999 comedy ""Election,"" set in a Midwestern high school, was brilliant, sometimes painful, sometimes hilarious. Best of all (I say this as a onetime high school teacher), it felt refreshingly authentic.""The Holdovers"" is quite the opposite: contrived, predictable, and intended to teach -- you guessed it -- a little lesson in compassion. An hour into it, I realized that it hadn't yet contained a single moment that seemed genuine, much less surprising. Every line of dialogue sounds phony. Characters speak in little announcements, spelling things out for us. Some of the characters -- a couple of menacing townies, for example -- are mere cartoons.Giamatti's protagonist is a wholly artificial creation, designed as if in a screenwriting course to follow the approved character arc -- initially stuffy and unsympathetic to the point of caricature, ultimately vulnerable. Ironically, an early scene between him and the school's headmaster violates what's sometimes regarded as a screenwriting rule: Do NOT, even in the interest of exposition, have people telling each other what they already know. (The by-the-numbers triteness of that conversation -- meant to show us that the instructor is uncompromising and pedantic but possesses old-fashioned integrity, blah blah blah -- put me off from the start.) The scenes between Giamatti and the school's cook -- in which, with the audience in mind, the two provide personal backstories and reveal their inner selves -- are painfully heavy-handed and at times so gooey that I felt sorry for the actress: ""You can't even dream a whole dream, can you?"" she is made to say at one point. ""What are you afraid of?""Yes, I know, everybody seems to love the movie. I could barely stomach it. But do check out ""Election."""
"The Holdovers","bdesdes","30 October 2023",810,"Very enjoyable film with outstanding performances and a wonderful warm vibe accompanied by the Christmas season. It's funny at times, sad at times, and feel-good. It's a story that almost all can relate to and will really touch your heart. It deals with so many themes, but mainly grief, the past, family, and what makes a person who they are. It's also very original and has a great script, cinematography, and soundtrack. I would highly advise to see it in the theaters as well as you really get the 70's vibe and deep moment on the big screen. There aren't many negatives to this film and I would recommend it to most people."
"The Holdovers","aharmas","29 October 2023",1010,"Here is a film that feels and looks like something out of the early seventies. The Holdovers is a strong and warm-hearted piece that gives actors roles with powerful lines, without any reliance on flashy editing and being overwhelmed by special effects.The story is simple three people get stuck for the Christmas holidays in a boarding school. It's cold, lonely, and boring for the parties involved. The adults drink to cope with whatever pressures they live with. The young man resorts to bad behavior and altercations with the teacher in charge.Through the vacation period these people will get to interact and get to know each other, something that will prove to a challenge to say the least. As the story evolves, we get to understand what has made the people who they are. We get to feel their pain and frustration through the very insightful writing of the director.It's a strong film with superb acting by the main leads. They have great chemistry together.Most outstanding is Paul Giamatti who plays the tormented and defensive man with relish and speaks volumes with his eyes.Hope the academy honors his performance as the best the year because no one else so far is coming close."
"The Holdovers","darkreignn","29 October 2023",910,"Let's just get this out of the way now - when it comes to writing this review, I'm probably a little bit biased (and a little bit drunk, currently, but that's besides the point). You see, I have an affinity for indie coming of age movies, and ""The Holdovers"" is basically an indie coming of age film, so it may - or may not - come as a surprise to you that I absolutely adored this picture. So, with that little preface out of the way, it's time for me to gush over this movie.Starring none other than Paul Giamatti as Paul Hunham, Giamatti plays a professor at an all boys boarding school where, over Christmas break, he has the misfortune of looking over a group of boys, one of whom is named Angus, played by Dominic Sessa. After a rocky start, where Paul clearly doesn't get along with any of the boys, making his disdain clear and evident, he eventually finds himself alone with Angus - as well as with the school's cook, Mary Lamb, played by Da'Vine Joy Randolph - in an unexpected chain of events. What occurs after is a slice-of-life style piece of cinema that allows broken people to find comfort in each other's company.""The Holdovers"" is, without a doubt, one of my favorite movies of 2023, as well as probably one of the best movies of the year, as well. This Christmas-themed gem doesn't hold back on the drama, delivering a thoughtful blend of comedy, coming-of-age storytelling, and a touch of romance - all wrapped around a very raw, human plot-line that virtually everyone can relate to. I'm no spring chicken myself, but I found myself deeply connected to both main characters - one who is older and basically dejected with life as he knows it, and one who is younger but who feels lost, aimless, and disconnected from both family and friends. And admittedly, not everyone will have a direct parallel to these experiences, but even if you don't, you're in for a story that's bound to tug at your heartstrings... and make you laugh out loud in the process.This is a high-quality movie - from the impeccable acting to the beautiful on-location cinematography to the relatable, thought-provoking plot, every element is executed with pinpoint precision and finesse; it's a testament to the art of storytelling on the silver screen. Director Alexander Payne knows how to create an artful film, and ""The Holdovers"" is no exception. It's at once indie and art-house while simultaneously being mainstream and easily accessible; in short, it's a film for everyone that actually feels like a genuine crowdpleaser instead of a pandering mess.I'm having a difficult time describing what I liked about this movie, and the reason is because I liked almost everything about this movie. So why the 9 out of 10 rating instead of the perfect 10? Literally the only thing that's holding me back is because I would've liked a touch more romance; yes, there was romance here, but a bit more would've pushed me over the edge into 10 out of 10 territory. Besides that, this is basically a perfect film, one that I loved, and one that has become one of my favorite movies of the year, if not of all time. I am genuinely looking forward to rewatching this, and I can't wait until it becomes closer to Christmas so I can view this on my own TV, cuddled under blankets, with a glass of whiskey, and bask in the absolute heartwarming experience that is ""The Holdovers."" My recommendation: Do yourself a favor and watch this as soon as you can - you won't regret it."
"The Holdovers","evanston_dad","20 November 2023",1010,"Mid-way through ""The Holdovers,"" I started openly weeping in the movie theater, and I pretty much kept it up on and off for the rest of the movie. Sometimes, there wasn't even anything obviously sad or moving happening in the scene, and I still couldn't stop. I think it's because this movie is so kind, and kindness is a rare commodity these days. It's sad to think that a movie about characters learning to have compassion for each other and for the hardships they've been through should feel like such a rare beast, but here we are.This is Alexander Payne firing on all cylinders as a director, and though he didn't write this movie, it feels like he could have. It's an obvious throwback to the kinds of movies Hal Ashby made throughout the 1970s and is touching in exactly the same way ""Harold and Maude"" was. It's also a master class in acting from the three principal characters played by Paul Giamatti, Dominic Sessa, and Da 'Vine Joy Randolph, and I hope all three of them, and the movie overall, is remembered come Oscar time.This will easily make my top ten list for the year.Grade: A+"
"The Holdovers","Xstal","28 November 2023",810,"Now here's a film with a life affirming theme, that should encourage most viewers to think of their dreams, and cascade away all their cloaks, inhibitions, and open fresh doors to their heart's intuitions; as a teacher whose life is as stale as dead fish, whose life is the opposite of happy and bliss, meets a boy who's ignored by all those he holds dear, and a friendship is formed that is warm and sincere; it's a subtle reflection of how we get trapped, by tradition and habits and past circumstance, where surroundings like prisons can temper our thinking, to distil all our spirit, to bottles for drinking; so embrace all the chances when they come along, break out of that mould and sing your own song, open your eyes to the paths unexplored, take a stand and stand tall, and stop being ignored."
"The Holdovers","steiner-sam","10 November 2023",910,"It's a comedy-drama set from December 16, 1970, to the first week of January 1971 in an exclusive boy's boarding school in New England and Boston, Massachusetts. It follows the experiences of the ""holdovers,"" that is, the students who cannot go home over the Christmas holidays and the two Barton staff left to supervise them during the holidays.There are five holdovers: Teddy Kountze (Brady Hepner), Jason Smith (Michael Provost), and Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa) are upper-class wealthy WASP students. Alex Ollerman (Ian Dolley) is a younger Mormon student whose parents are on a mission in South America. Ye-Joon Park (Jim Kaplan) is from South Korea.Left to supervise is Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti), an unmarried ancient history teacher who was once a student at Barton and has taught there all his career. He's a demanding curmudgeon who almost everyone dislikes. African American Mary Lamb (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), the head cook, is also present; her son, a Barton grad, has just been killed in Vietnam.The film follows the shared experiences of the holdovers, though four students leave after a week when a wealthy father takes them for a ski holiday. Paul cannot contact Angus's parents, so he must stay with Paul and Mary at Barton. We also meet the school's headmaster, Hardy Woodrup (Andrew Garman), his administrative assistant, Lydia Crane (Carrie Preston), and janitor Danny (Naheem Garcia).""The Holdovers"" is a delightful comedy leavened with wisdom as we learn the dark secrets that have shaped Paul Hunham and Angus Tully. Giamatti, Sessa, and Randolph are all excellent. The script unfolds the twists and turns superbly. ""The Holdovers"" is a great Christmas movie."
"The Holdovers","JohnDeSando","16 November 2023",NA,"""I find the world a bitter and complicated place. And it seems to feel the same way about me."" Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti)Teaching privileged boys at an elite new England prep school called Barton (think for example, Philips Exeter), might be the pinnacle of an academic's career. But not Paul Hunham in The Holdovers, an elite movie itself of the year.Paul should be teaching classics at an ivy school, not teaching entitled ""vermin,"" among the many sobriquets he tosses around about the fortunate young men to experience his brand of grumpy intellectualism and misanthropy. He prepares them for a world that won't always be coddling and protecting them as their family wealth so naturally does in their early years.Director Alexander Payne worked with Giamatti in Sideways, so he is prepared to have another winning cynical character who is endearing while distanced by negative temperament from normally positive fellow humans (Paul's last name, Hunham, suggests a distant connection with the better angels of humanity).As Paul accepts the assignment to supervise holdovers (exiled to Christmas vacation in the absence of parents or guardians), the number whittles down to just Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa, reminiscent of young, Timothy Chalamet and Adam Driver), who shares Paul's dark attitudes and, with the sharp writing of David Hemingson, some witty dialogue- e.g., about Paul he says, ""I thought all of the Nazis had left for Argentina.""Although, as in likeminded dramas such as Dead Poet's Society or Goodbye, Mr. Chips, the principals are destined to be transformed into more humane characters, Holdovers continues, even in its denouement, to accentuate the unsunny side of life for Paul and Tully, whose fortunes are still compromised by cold-hearted parents and administrators. The chilly world, however, is warmed on these lovely, snowbound days, by women, viz., the cook, Mary (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) and administrator Lydia (Carrie Preston).Mary good-naturedly deals with the death of her son, Curtis, a Barton grad who had to join the military because he did not have the resources as other Barton grads of the late '60s did to avoid the draft.Lydia, an attractive middle-aged staff member, holds the promise of a love interest for Paul, only to show how difficult it is for social exiles to enter the romantic mainstream.The Holdovers is a small gem of a move that will immediately remind buffs about Hal Ashby comedies of the same era like Harold & Maude, where character development is paramount and detachment from the mainstream is required to look at humanity clearly with its foibles and endearments.The Holdovers is a movie everyone can enjoy with endearing characters who share with us our moments about loneliness peppered with the possibilities of love and happiness.""Do you think I want to be babysitting you? No. I was praying your mother would pick up the phone, or your father would arrive in a helicopter or a flying saucer...."" Paul Hunham."
"The Holdovers","dtswpod","6 November 2023",810,"Do you miss how they used to make films in the 1970s? Plenty of filmmakers do, except they take that nostalgia and just do watered down versions of better movies. As an example see Taxi Driver and King of Comedy then watch Joker and you'll get what I mean.Thankfully, Alexander Payne has managed to take his sentimentality and make an original film out of it. Or if The Holdovers is a pale imitation of a superior picture then the filmmaker has managed to trick me because I don't feel as if I've seen this movie before but done better.Now to be clear, there aren't things you've never seen before in the movie. I mean, you know the characters are going to bond at some point. And people will grow to care about each other. That's a given. How we get there, however, is what makes the film seem fresh and entertaining and ever bit as good as any flick made back in the day.I hope more people see it."
"The Holdovers","tdwillis-26273","7 December 2023",810,"Finally......a GOOD movie. The story/script, although not a breakthrough idea, was heartfelt,full and real.The settings were also real and gorgeous (not really a cgi fan)
Camera, cinematography, lighting,sound,score....every level made my eyes and ears satisfyingly full.Acting was oscarworthy across the board.Directing was brilliant.Only negative I can come up with is that the pace was a bit slow, but so much of the movie is so focused and so superbly and beautifully made I just sat back and enjoyed it.A very thoughtful substantial and beautiful movie. A rare gem in today's superficial gimmicky movie making world."
"The Holdovers","ferguson-6","8 November 2023",810,"Greetings again from the darkness. We've all had that teacher. You know, the one with an evil streak who just seemed to thrive on making students miserable. Throw in a staff and administrators who feel the same way, and the casting choice for the teacher becomes obvious. Enter the always great and perfectly curmudgeonly Paul Giamatti. This is the first time Giamatti has worked with two-time Oscar winner Alexander Payne since their brilliant SIDEWAYS (2004), and it's clear these two share a wavelength for comedy and drama, even in throwback form.Paul Hunham (Giamatti) is a long-time professor at Barton Academy, an all-boys private prep school located in the snowy northeast. It's December 1970, and an early scene exemplifies how he relishes the failing grades he bestows upon desperate students so afraid to disappoint their rich parents. In the final class before the holiday break, the student-teacher banter doesn't go so well for the boys, and they head to break with an extra workload. Hunham is easily manipulated into babysitting the titular holdovers - students stuck at school over the break, while most others spend time with family, often on exotic trips.Initially there are five students, but after a certain development, what remains is Hunham, smart but troubled Angus Tully (first timer Dominic Sessa) and the school's head cook, Mary Lamb (a divine Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019). Hunham is perpetually annoyed and has a weakness for booze. Angus is frustrated that his mother left him at school so she could travel with her new husband, and Mary is grieving over her son who was killed in Vietnam. Watching these three struggle to bond is a case study in psychology, yet of course we know they will ultimately form a family of misfits, depending on each other to offset the loneliness.The genius tagline for the film is ""Discomfort and Joy"", and initially the first overshadows the latter. Isolated from the world in their own way, the three characters begin to influence each other, showing broken/wounded people need and deserve love and friendship as much as anyone else. ""Entre nous"" (just between us) becomes a kind of calling card for this trio, and a Christmas party thrown by an eternally optimistic staffer (Carrie Preston) is a turning point.Giamatti is master of this material and only goes over the top a time or two. It's painful and humorous each time he is so anxious to infuse his breadth of ancient civilization facts into even the most mundane conversations. Newcomer Sessa possesses star potential and nails a complex first role. Da'Vine Joy Randolph's Mary is the heart of the film, doling out advice to Hunham and comfort to Angus. Depression is a vein running through these characters and it's acknowledged, though not the focus.This is Alexander Payne's first film since the disappointing DOWNSIZING (2017), but his brilliance has been proven in ABOUT SCHMIDT (2002), SIDEWAYS (2004), THE DESCENDANTS (2011), and NEBRASKA (2013). This time he's working from a screenplay by successful TV writer, David Hemingson, and though there is never much suspense about where the story or characters are headed, we enjoy the ride immensely. Cinematography from Eigil Byrld (IN BRUGES, 2008), perfectly complements the emotions (shot on digital, graininess added in post), and the soundtrack is period-specific, including the great Cat Stevens. Pay attention to the retro opening credits and logos, and enjoy a smart and funny film (an Alexander Payne trademark).Opening in theaters November 10, 2023."
"The Holdovers","akcenat","1 January 2024",810,"""The Holdovers"" is a captivating blend of comedy and drama that beautifully explores the complexities of human relationships.Story is about a grumpy instructor (Paul Giamatti) at a New England prep school who forms an unexpected bond with a troubled student during the Christmas break. Because it is set in the 1970s, the film in a way is a nostalgic journey back in time, but with a narrative that is both engaging and thought-provoking.The performances are exceptional, with Giamatti delivering a compelling portrayal of a man grappling with his own loneliness and the challenges of mentorship. The film's narrative is richly layered, exploring themes of loneliness, friendship, and personal growth. It's a story that resonates, offering a poignant reflection on the human condition. The film's setting in the 1970s adds a layer of nostalgia, further enhancing the emotional depth of the narrative. Despite its lengthy runtime, ""The Holdovers"" mostly maintains a steady pace, balancing its dramatic elements with moments of humor and warmth. The main plus of the movie is its dialogue-driven approach that adds to its charm, creating a sense of authenticity and depth in its character interactions.Overall, this is a film that leaves a lasting impression, offering a thoughtful exploration of human relationships set against the backdrop of a bygone era. With its exceptional performances and engaging narrative, I'm giving it an 8 out of 10 rating. It's a must-watch for those seeking a film that combines drama, comedy, and a touch of nostalgia."
"The Holdovers","Quinoa1984","30 October 2023",1010,"The Holdovers is, for all of the character dynamics and dysfunction and depression and other things we find out about the leads, mostly with Mr. Hunham and Angus and how their characters over these couple of weeks turn away from the ""Barton"" way of not telling lies (because, well, sometimes context and the moment matter for telling a lie that won't really hurt, maybe), a strangely comforting film to watch. Not for all of that exactly, though what we understand slowly but surely is this is all material for comedy and tragedy in equal measure, but because of the feeling that we get with a filmmaker who is so primed and confident with material that you don't feel like it can go wrong.What is more impressive is that, as enjoyable as the first half is, it is in the ""I like this"" mode as we are introduced to this world and Hunham and Angus and Mary, but it doesn't feel so special. But I should have known Payne and writer David Hemingson were laying down the necessary groundwork for what comes the moment a) the majority of the other supporting characters leave for reasons I don't have to mention here, and b) then the characters go outside the Barton campus grounds on a holiday party and then a ""field trip"" to Boston, you get the sense moment by moment and interaction by interaction it is so sharp and cutting and wise, and one scene in particular makes the jump into ""oh, OK, this is taking off into another level of personal pain and about familial expectations and what will come with in a life measuring up to others - and why that is wrong - and... yeah, it's great"" territory.In other words, it's the kind of film I want to watch again right away simply because now that I know a little more about the characters, I'll want to experience all of the extra textures (its 1970 down to the wood paneling and the car seats), and dig a little more into those absolutely wonderful natural restrained and complete performances - we take Giamatti for granted sometimes and this is a character he should be proud of to craft, lazy-ass eyes and all; Sessa's first role and he is an immediate star; I can't be more sure of anything for the next Oscar's that, if Randolph is nominated, she will win, if nothing else for everything she does at the Christmas party scenes, and a moment looking over some objects in a room later on is so moving - and my comfort is in seeing Payne clearly loving directing this intimate character study where he can show what a comedically observant, quick witted, and heartbreaking story this all is.It's one of the best Christmas movies in several years, embodying many themes and ideals that fit like a 70s wool sweater, and I'm sure the first thing Payne must have thought after reading the script was ""whoa. This is gonna be the best Hal Ashby or Bob Rafelson movie never made... is 'The Last Holdover' too on the nose?"" Even Hunham would give this... a B+ probably (did he ever give As? Shrug)."
"The Holdovers","jjgonzalez-06426","31 October 2023",910,"Quite possibly one of the best Christmas films ever? I first saw Payne & Giamatti's previous film together, ""Sideways"" during my screenwriting training class, and it is one that I would think of for a while. Their new film, ""The Holdovers"", is hilarious, beautifully shot and acted, heartwarming, and has a great sense of grief and joy meshed together. Definitely leaning towards Randolph for Best Supporting Actress; her performance BLEW me away.Overall, I love these films. Light-hearted & comedic while also have a sense of darkness and a lot of heavy emotion to it. Definitely is one of the most heartfelt films of the year."
"The Holdovers","paul-allaer","20 November 2023",810,"As ""The Holdovers"" (2023 release; 133 min.) opens, it's 1970 and we are at the Barton HS boarding school in New England as the Fall semester wraps up. Paul Hunham, a teacher of classical studies and a curmudgeon, gets summoned by the head of school, and is told he will take charge of the 4 or 5 ""holdovers"", students who for one reason or another, cannot go home and need to stay at the boarding school for the entire Christmas break... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest from director Alexander Payne (""Sideways"", ""The Descendants""). Here he brings to the big screen what life is like in Fall of 1970 among a group of privileged HS students along with their testy classics teacher and a Black woman who runs the kitchen. On the surface of it all, this looks to be a terrible combination, but as the movie plays out, more and more is revealed. The movie is plot-heavy and I shan't say another word on that. Paul Giamatti, a regular of Payne's prior movie work, brings what I feel is one of his strongest movie roles ever. Da'Vine Joy Randolph is outstanding as the Black kitchen supervisor with a heavy heart. Dominic Sessa is frankly too old (33 in real life) to play the rebellious HS student Angus (17 in the movie), I mean, it's really really obvious. That said, Payne just hits all the right notes in this film, and this resonated with me on so many levels. Despite the serious undertones, there are quite a few funny moments in the movie as well.""The Holdovers"" premiered a few months ago at the Telluride film festival to immediate and widespread critical acclaim. There is good reason why this is currently rated 87% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. The movie opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati the weekend before last. The early Sunday evening screening where I saw this at was attended so-so (about 12-15 people). If you are in the mood for a top-notch comedy drama, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion."
"The Holdovers","imseeg","14 December 2023",610,"I am big fan of director Alexander Payne (The Descendants, Sideways) and of actor Paul Giamatti in particular. Both have teamed up before with marvellous results, but this movie has got 1 problem that made me only rate it with 6 stars though:The bad:the middle part of this story stretches out too long, with several quite tedious scenes, which could have easily been cut out of it without hurting the storyline. I started watching at my watch half way through several times because of this lack of spark and punch. Such a pity!Fortunately this movie picked up momentum again towards the warmhearted Christmas spirited final, but I still will only award this movie with 6 stars (instead of 7) because I got bored at many moments during the somewhat tedious and long middle part.The story: It's about a young student and his teacher, who both are lonely souls and although they cant stand each other at first, eventually slowly do bond with each other during a Christmas holiday. Acting by Paul Giamatti is masterful (as always), BUT some of the other actors fail to impress me.Not the best of director Alexander Payne's work, but definitely still worth a watch, because it left me in my seat with a smile on my face and a feel good Christmas spirit of caring for one another!"
"The Holdovers","cparousis-30615","1 January 2024",1010,"Sad, poignant, funny, and beautiful are words that best describe this film. If this film doesn't make you feel sone kind of emotion, you are absolutely heartless. You love these characters. You feel for them on every single level. The film itself feels like a film from the 70s. The twists and turns the film takes are wonderful and heartwarming/heartbreaking. Paul Giamatti is excellent as always. This is Dominic Sessa's first film and he does an outstanding job. No crazy special effects or bloated explosions. Just great filmmaking. It's streaming on Peacock. An absolute holiday must. Take the time to watch it. You'll love it."
"The Holdovers","arfdawg-1","26 December 2023",510,"Lots of great reviews here. Many people who have seen Sideways seem to be excited that Giamatti has re-teamed with Payne the director.Of course, the film is in no way related to the other movie, except that both were involved and that Sideways has quite a cult following.Unfortunately this is not my type of movie. I'm not saying it's bad. And I'm not saying anything bad about the people who seem to love it. It's just not for me.It's a character driven movie, which is fine, except I didnt bond with any of the characters. And I found the choice of musical tunes throughout to be annoying at best.So if you like drawn out period piece character driven flicks, you may like this one. I didn't love it, but I could see how some might, hence the ""5"" rating."
"The Holdovers","kevin_robbins","31 December 2023",910,"My wife and I watched The Holdovers (2023) on Peacock last night. The storyline unfolds at a boarding school in Massachusetts during holiday vacation, focusing on the kids with nowhere to go for the holidays and the staff assigned to care for them, who happen to be facing a similar issue. Together, they work to uncover inner demons and find a way to release them, allowing everyone to truly enjoy the holiday season.Directed by Alexander Payne (Sideways), the film stars Paul Giamatti (American Splendor), Da'Vine Joy Randolph (Dolemite is my Name), Dominic Sessa, and Carrie Preston (Claws).This is an exceptionally unique holiday film, offering intriguing settings, characters, and circumstances. All facets are fascinating and worthwhile, with outstanding writing that establishes the storyline and various subplots effectively. The dialogue is absolutely superb, featuring a well-balanced blend of raw emotion, character development, and comedy. The eyebrow-raising conclusion is perfect for the characters' concluding direction.In conclusion, The Holdovers is a unique and captivating character piece that's an absolute must-see. I would score this a 9/10 and strongly recommend it."
"The Holdovers","euroGary","19 October 2023",1010,"One does not expect a Christmas film to be challenging, and this one certainly isn't. But it is a lot of fun.A boys' boarding school empties of almost all staff and pupils for the 1970/1 Festive Season. Left behind are Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti), the unpopular history teacher who has to keep an eye on the school; Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa), a teenaged pupil whose mother does not want him on her honeymoon; and Mary Lamb (the impressively-named Da'Vine Joy Randolph), the school cook who is facing her first Christmas alone since her son died on military service. As these three lonely souls come together, there are tantrums, emotional revelations, the revealing of long-hidden secrets, a noble sacrifice... the usual stuff.Also the usual stuff are the characters: Paul is cynical and frustrated; Angus is ironic and insecure; and as Mary is overweight and black, she of course has to be sassy.But while in some films such predictability would be annoying, it works here. Within the limits of their somewhat two-dimensional personalities, the characters are well-written - even Angus' tantrums do not seem unreasonable. Plus, there are some great gags (""You hit him? You mean you punched him out?"" ""No, I hit him with a car..."") And I will not be the only viewer who finishes the film with a lump in his throat.Great fun. I can easily see myself buying the DVD and watching this for many Christmases to come..."
"The Holdovers","cherold","31 December 2023",810,"This movie is about a handful of entitled boys who regretfully must stay behind during the Christmas break at their private school and the teacher and cook there to oversee them.It's a funny and affecting movie with excellent performances from the leads, especially Paul giamatti as the prickly teacher.It's a Christmas movie of sorts, since it does take place at Christmas, but it's really more of an anytime of the year film in which you get to see people have adventures and fight and grow and that sort of thing.It's very well filmed, it's very entertaining, and I would recommend you watch it."
"The Holdovers","bastille-852-731547","29 October 2023",610,"Set in December 1970, ""The Holdovers"" follows a small group of students who have to stay on campus over the Christmas break at Barton Academy (a prestigious boarding school in Massachusetts,) alongside a curmudgeonly ancient history teacher (Paul Giamatti.) That sounds like a potentially amusing premise for a breezy comedy-drama, especially when Alexander Payne is directing. Having greatly enjoyed and admired several of Payne's previous films such as ""Sideways,"" ""The Descendants,"" and ""Nebraska,"" I was looking forward to this film. Overall, I found it to be simply fine and not up to par with the level of quality of most of Payne's films. There's nothing too wrong with it by any stretch of the imagination, but it's often generic and forgettable compared to Payne's other films.An indie dramedy like this film would generally be expected to be defined by being character- and writing-driven. Unfortunately, neither the characters nor the writing here are especially unique enough to structure a compelling plot around. Paul (Giamatti's character) is very generic, as is the rebellious student Angus, whose relationship with Paul is a pivotal part of the film. On a better note, Da'Vine Joy Randolph gives a strong and impactful performance as Mary, a cafeteria worker dealing with bereavement; her character is interestingly more dynamic and multi-dimensional than either Paul or Angus. The writing and humor is less unique, funny, or engaging than many of Payne's films, as the attempts at plot devices, character development, and humor often boil down to insult comedy between Paul and Angus--which, ultimately, wears out its welcome a bit, and actually causes a bit of collateral damage in making the film's tone and story feel less sincere. Regardless of the sincerity of the story, another thing that is clear here is that there needed to be a stronger and less predictable core to the plot in order for the film to remain engaging for its 133-minute runtime.The film's retro, 1970s-aesthetic is commendable and helps contribute to the atmosphere of the film, and there still are some sporadic sweet moments of Paul and Mary hanging out around the television and a few decent jokes here and there. So ""The Holdovers"" is a fine enough film, but it won't be a new holiday classic for me. 6/10."
"The Holdovers","RahulM007","31 October 2023",1010,"""Penis cancer in human form.""Alexander Payne's ""The Holdovers"" is a laugh-out-loud comedy strengthened by Paul Giamatti and Dominic Sessa's magnetic performances and their incredible chemistry together. I am in awe by the film's brilliant and inventive screenplay, 70s-style cinematography, slick editing, and great production design. I could watch Paul and Angus bicker for another two hours. Throughout the film, the humour gets more interwoven leading to a crescendo of hilarity. ""The Holdovers"" offers the perfect blend of humor and pathos.*That waitress was so rude for refusing to accept their order of cherries jubilee. She is a fascist and a ""penis cancer in human form"".*The film reminded me of Peter Weir's ""Dead Poets Society"", Milos Forman's ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", and John Hughes' ""The Breakfast Club"" (kind of).Final verdict: 10/10."
"The Holdovers","Avwillfan89","29 November 2023",910,"Finally, Alexander Payne has made a worthy follow up to his (in my opinion at least) masterpiece Sideways.I really related so much to all three of the main characters, who all come from different backgrounds. Paul Giamatti, brilliant in almost anything he does, plays a grumpy, alcoholic, sour professor who does not suffer fools and doesn't cut his privileged students any slack. Dominic Sessa is troubled teen with a dysfunctional family and mental issues. D'Avine Joy Randolf is a grieving mother stuck in a job wanting to make ends meet for her family, by her choice.This movie has great character development, a wholesome story with flawed yet lovable characters you can root for and terrific, funny dialogue. Simple, yet perfect. 9 out of 10."
"The Holdovers","frankde-jong","27 December 2023",910,"I had a lot of associations when I started watching ""The holdovers"".Kids stuck in a school during the Christmas vacation, is that not a little bit like ""The breakfast club"" (1985, John Hughes)? No, because most of the kids go away early in the film and we are left with just one pupil (Angus Tully played by Dominic Sessa) and a teacher (Paul Hunham played by Paul Giamatti).Paul Hunham teaches ancient languages and culture. Does that sounds like the Donna Tartt novel ""The secret history"" (1992)? No, in that novel the pupils are inspired by their teacher. In ""The holdovers"" the teacher is hated.One association that I did not have at all prior to watching the movie may be the most accurate: ""Scent of a woman"" (1992, Martin Brest). Also in this film a high school pupil on an expensive boarding school and a grumpy old man are condemned to each other.Best of all however we can see ""The holdovers"" as the comeback of Alexander Payne after his failed film ""Downsizing"" (2017). The film is situated in 1970 and has a very 70's look and feel, down to the aspect ratio then used. The film also contains very beautiful images of Norteast American landscapes.First of all however the film is about its three main characters. Apart from the two already introduced we have the chief cook of the boarding school Mary Lamb (Da'Vine Joy Randolph). These three people form a sort of substitute family that has to spend the Christmas season together. Each of them has his/her problems but during the film they grow closer to each other, or at least learn to understand each other better.Being a Christmas movie you expect a happy ending and somewhere in the middle of the film this happy ending seems to consist of all the members of the proxy family being on their way towards an unexpected romance. The greatness of the film is that these romances do not materialize fully. The message of the film seems to be that gaining better understanding is a happy enough ending.By the way the film does not shy away from some social criticism. The character of Paul Hunham is meant to be grumpy at first, but to me he was instantly sympathetic when he made the headmaster of the boarding school very clear that in his class wealthy parents could not buy good grades for their sons. Later he says to his pupils (at that stage of the film there are still a couple of them) that they ought to be aware of their privileged status. ""You go to Harvard, poorer boys go to Vietnam"". The Vietnam war plays an important role in the background anyway. The son of the chief cook has died in Vietnam and while visiting a bar in the village nearby the boarding school there is a local boy that lost one of his hands in Vietnam.All in all ""The holdovers"" is a very convincing comeback of Alexander Payne. He made an instant Christmas classic!"
"The Holdovers","210west","14 January 2024",410,"Alexander Payne's 1999 comedy ""Election,"" set in a Midwestern high school, was brilliant, sometimes painful, sometimes hilarious. Best of all (I say this as a onetime high school teacher), it felt refreshingly authentic.""The Holdovers"" is quite the opposite: contrived, predictable, and intended to teach -- you guessed it -- a little lesson in compassion. An hour into it, I realized that it hadn't yet contained a single moment that seemed genuine, much less surprising. Every line of dialogue sounds phony. Characters speak in little announcements, spelling things out for us. Some of the characters -- a couple of menacing townies, for example -- are mere cartoons.Giamatti's protagonist is a wholly artificial creation, designed as if in a screenwriting course to follow the approved character arc -- initially stuffy and unsympathetic to the point of caricature, ultimately vulnerable. Ironically, an early scene between him and the school's headmaster violates what's sometimes regarded as a screenwriting rule: Do NOT, even in the interest of exposition, have people telling each other what they already know. (The by-the-numbers triteness of that conversation -- meant to show us that the instructor is uncompromising and pedantic but possesses old-fashioned integrity, blah blah blah -- put me off from the start.) The scenes between Giamatti and the school's cook -- in which, with the audience in mind, the two provide personal backstories and reveal their inner selves -- are painfully heavy-handed and at times so gooey that I felt sorry for the actress: ""You can't even dream a whole dream, can you?"" she is made to say at one point. ""What are you afraid of?""Yes, I know, everybody seems to love the movie. I could barely stomach it. But do check out ""Election."""
"The Holdovers","bdesdes","30 October 2023",810,"Very enjoyable film with outstanding performances and a wonderful warm vibe accompanied by the Christmas season. It's funny at times, sad at times, and feel-good. It's a story that almost all can relate to and will really touch your heart. It deals with so many themes, but mainly grief, the past, family, and what makes a person who they are. It's also very original and has a great script, cinematography, and soundtrack. I would highly advise to see it in the theaters as well as you really get the 70's vibe and deep moment on the big screen. There aren't many negatives to this film and I would recommend it to most people."
"The Holdovers","aharmas","29 October 2023",1010,"Here is a film that feels and looks like something out of the early seventies. The Holdovers is a strong and warm-hearted piece that gives actors roles with powerful lines, without any reliance on flashy editing and being overwhelmed by special effects.The story is simple three people get stuck for the Christmas holidays in a boarding school. It's cold, lonely, and boring for the parties involved. The adults drink to cope with whatever pressures they live with. The young man resorts to bad behavior and altercations with the teacher in charge.Through the vacation period these people will get to interact and get to know each other, something that will prove to a challenge to say the least. As the story evolves, we get to understand what has made the people who they are. We get to feel their pain and frustration through the very insightful writing of the director.It's a strong film with superb acting by the main leads. They have great chemistry together.Most outstanding is Paul Giamatti who plays the tormented and defensive man with relish and speaks volumes with his eyes.Hope the academy honors his performance as the best the year because no one else so far is coming close."
"The Holdovers","darkreignn","29 October 2023",910,"Let's just get this out of the way now - when it comes to writing this review, I'm probably a little bit biased (and a little bit drunk, currently, but that's besides the point). You see, I have an affinity for indie coming of age movies, and ""The Holdovers"" is basically an indie coming of age film, so it may - or may not - come as a surprise to you that I absolutely adored this picture. So, with that little preface out of the way, it's time for me to gush over this movie.Starring none other than Paul Giamatti as Paul Hunham, Giamatti plays a professor at an all boys boarding school where, over Christmas break, he has the misfortune of looking over a group of boys, one of whom is named Angus, played by Dominic Sessa. After a rocky start, where Paul clearly doesn't get along with any of the boys, making his disdain clear and evident, he eventually finds himself alone with Angus - as well as with the school's cook, Mary Lamb, played by Da'Vine Joy Randolph - in an unexpected chain of events. What occurs after is a slice-of-life style piece of cinema that allows broken people to find comfort in each other's company.""The Holdovers"" is, without a doubt, one of my favorite movies of 2023, as well as probably one of the best movies of the year, as well. This Christmas-themed gem doesn't hold back on the drama, delivering a thoughtful blend of comedy, coming-of-age storytelling, and a touch of romance - all wrapped around a very raw, human plot-line that virtually everyone can relate to. I'm no spring chicken myself, but I found myself deeply connected to both main characters - one who is older and basically dejected with life as he knows it, and one who is younger but who feels lost, aimless, and disconnected from both family and friends. And admittedly, not everyone will have a direct parallel to these experiences, but even if you don't, you're in for a story that's bound to tug at your heartstrings... and make you laugh out loud in the process.This is a high-quality movie - from the impeccable acting to the beautiful on-location cinematography to the relatable, thought-provoking plot, every element is executed with pinpoint precision and finesse; it's a testament to the art of storytelling on the silver screen. Director Alexander Payne knows how to create an artful film, and ""The Holdovers"" is no exception. It's at once indie and art-house while simultaneously being mainstream and easily accessible; in short, it's a film for everyone that actually feels like a genuine crowdpleaser instead of a pandering mess.I'm having a difficult time describing what I liked about this movie, and the reason is because I liked almost everything about this movie. So why the 9 out of 10 rating instead of the perfect 10? Literally the only thing that's holding me back is because I would've liked a touch more romance; yes, there was romance here, but a bit more would've pushed me over the edge into 10 out of 10 territory. Besides that, this is basically a perfect film, one that I loved, and one that has become one of my favorite movies of the year, if not of all time. I am genuinely looking forward to rewatching this, and I can't wait until it becomes closer to Christmas so I can view this on my own TV, cuddled under blankets, with a glass of whiskey, and bask in the absolute heartwarming experience that is ""The Holdovers."" My recommendation: Do yourself a favor and watch this as soon as you can - you won't regret it."
"The Holdovers","evanston_dad","20 November 2023",1010,"Mid-way through ""The Holdovers,"" I started openly weeping in the movie theater, and I pretty much kept it up on and off for the rest of the movie. Sometimes, there wasn't even anything obviously sad or moving happening in the scene, and I still couldn't stop. I think it's because this movie is so kind, and kindness is a rare commodity these days. It's sad to think that a movie about characters learning to have compassion for each other and for the hardships they've been through should feel like such a rare beast, but here we are.This is Alexander Payne firing on all cylinders as a director, and though he didn't write this movie, it feels like he could have. It's an obvious throwback to the kinds of movies Hal Ashby made throughout the 1970s and is touching in exactly the same way ""Harold and Maude"" was. It's also a master class in acting from the three principal characters played by Paul Giamatti, Dominic Sessa, and Da 'Vine Joy Randolph, and I hope all three of them, and the movie overall, is remembered come Oscar time.This will easily make my top ten list for the year.Grade: A+"
"The Holdovers","Xstal","28 November 2023",810,"Now here's a film with a life affirming theme, that should encourage most viewers to think of their dreams, and cascade away all their cloaks, inhibitions, and open fresh doors to their heart's intuitions; as a teacher whose life is as stale as dead fish, whose life is the opposite of happy and bliss, meets a boy who's ignored by all those he holds dear, and a friendship is formed that is warm and sincere; it's a subtle reflection of how we get trapped, by tradition and habits and past circumstance, where surroundings like prisons can temper our thinking, to distil all our spirit, to bottles for drinking; so embrace all the chances when they come along, break out of that mould and sing your own song, open your eyes to the paths unexplored, take a stand and stand tall, and stop being ignored."
"The Holdovers","steiner-sam","10 November 2023",910,"It's a comedy-drama set from December 16, 1970, to the first week of January 1971 in an exclusive boy's boarding school in New England and Boston, Massachusetts. It follows the experiences of the ""holdovers,"" that is, the students who cannot go home over the Christmas holidays and the two Barton staff left to supervise them during the holidays.There are five holdovers: Teddy Kountze (Brady Hepner), Jason Smith (Michael Provost), and Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa) are upper-class wealthy WASP students. Alex Ollerman (Ian Dolley) is a younger Mormon student whose parents are on a mission in South America. Ye-Joon Park (Jim Kaplan) is from South Korea.Left to supervise is Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti), an unmarried ancient history teacher who was once a student at Barton and has taught there all his career. He's a demanding curmudgeon who almost everyone dislikes. African American Mary Lamb (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), the head cook, is also present; her son, a Barton grad, has just been killed in Vietnam.The film follows the shared experiences of the holdovers, though four students leave after a week when a wealthy father takes them for a ski holiday. Paul cannot contact Angus's parents, so he must stay with Paul and Mary at Barton. We also meet the school's headmaster, Hardy Woodrup (Andrew Garman), his administrative assistant, Lydia Crane (Carrie Preston), and janitor Danny (Naheem Garcia).""The Holdovers"" is a delightful comedy leavened with wisdom as we learn the dark secrets that have shaped Paul Hunham and Angus Tully. Giamatti, Sessa, and Randolph are all excellent. The script unfolds the twists and turns superbly. ""The Holdovers"" is a great Christmas movie."
"The Holdovers","JohnDeSando","16 November 2023",NA,"""I find the world a bitter and complicated place. And it seems to feel the same way about me."" Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti)Teaching privileged boys at an elite new England prep school called Barton (think for example, Philips Exeter), might be the pinnacle of an academic's career. But not Paul Hunham in The Holdovers, an elite movie itself of the year.Paul should be teaching classics at an ivy school, not teaching entitled ""vermin,"" among the many sobriquets he tosses around about the fortunate young men to experience his brand of grumpy intellectualism and misanthropy. He prepares them for a world that won't always be coddling and protecting them as their family wealth so naturally does in their early years.Director Alexander Payne worked with Giamatti in Sideways, so he is prepared to have another winning cynical character who is endearing while distanced by negative temperament from normally positive fellow humans (Paul's last name, Hunham, suggests a distant connection with the better angels of humanity).As Paul accepts the assignment to supervise holdovers (exiled to Christmas vacation in the absence of parents or guardians), the number whittles down to just Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa, reminiscent of young, Timothy Chalamet and Adam Driver), who shares Paul's dark attitudes and, with the sharp writing of David Hemingson, some witty dialogue- e.g., about Paul he says, ""I thought all of the Nazis had left for Argentina.""Although, as in likeminded dramas such as Dead Poet's Society or Goodbye, Mr. Chips, the principals are destined to be transformed into more humane characters, Holdovers continues, even in its denouement, to accentuate the unsunny side of life for Paul and Tully, whose fortunes are still compromised by cold-hearted parents and administrators. The chilly world, however, is warmed on these lovely, snowbound days, by women, viz., the cook, Mary (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) and administrator Lydia (Carrie Preston).Mary good-naturedly deals with the death of her son, Curtis, a Barton grad who had to join the military because he did not have the resources as other Barton grads of the late '60s did to avoid the draft.Lydia, an attractive middle-aged staff member, holds the promise of a love interest for Paul, only to show how difficult it is for social exiles to enter the romantic mainstream.The Holdovers is a small gem of a move that will immediately remind buffs about Hal Ashby comedies of the same era like Harold & Maude, where character development is paramount and detachment from the mainstream is required to look at humanity clearly with its foibles and endearments.The Holdovers is a movie everyone can enjoy with endearing characters who share with us our moments about loneliness peppered with the possibilities of love and happiness.""Do you think I want to be babysitting you? No. I was praying your mother would pick up the phone, or your father would arrive in a helicopter or a flying saucer...."" Paul Hunham."
"The Holdovers","dtswpod","6 November 2023",810,"Do you miss how they used to make films in the 1970s? Plenty of filmmakers do, except they take that nostalgia and just do watered down versions of better movies. As an example see Taxi Driver and King of Comedy then watch Joker and you'll get what I mean.Thankfully, Alexander Payne has managed to take his sentimentality and make an original film out of it. Or if The Holdovers is a pale imitation of a superior picture then the filmmaker has managed to trick me because I don't feel as if I've seen this movie before but done better.Now to be clear, there aren't things you've never seen before in the movie. I mean, you know the characters are going to bond at some point. And people will grow to care about each other. That's a given. How we get there, however, is what makes the film seem fresh and entertaining and ever bit as good as any flick made back in the day.I hope more people see it."
"The Holdovers","tdwillis-26273","7 December 2023",810,"Finally......a GOOD movie. The story/script, although not a breakthrough idea, was heartfelt,full and real.The settings were also real and gorgeous (not really a cgi fan)
Camera, cinematography, lighting,sound,score....every level made my eyes and ears satisfyingly full.Acting was oscarworthy across the board.Directing was brilliant.Only negative I can come up with is that the pace was a bit slow, but so much of the movie is so focused and so superbly and beautifully made I just sat back and enjoyed it.A very thoughtful substantial and beautiful movie. A rare gem in today's superficial gimmicky movie making world."
"The Holdovers","ferguson-6","8 November 2023",810,"Greetings again from the darkness. We've all had that teacher. You know, the one with an evil streak who just seemed to thrive on making students miserable. Throw in a staff and administrators who feel the same way, and the casting choice for the teacher becomes obvious. Enter the always great and perfectly curmudgeonly Paul Giamatti. This is the first time Giamatti has worked with two-time Oscar winner Alexander Payne since their brilliant SIDEWAYS (2004), and it's clear these two share a wavelength for comedy and drama, even in throwback form.Paul Hunham (Giamatti) is a long-time professor at Barton Academy, an all-boys private prep school located in the snowy northeast. It's December 1970, and an early scene exemplifies how he relishes the failing grades he bestows upon desperate students so afraid to disappoint their rich parents. In the final class before the holiday break, the student-teacher banter doesn't go so well for the boys, and they head to break with an extra workload. Hunham is easily manipulated into babysitting the titular holdovers - students stuck at school over the break, while most others spend time with family, often on exotic trips.Initially there are five students, but after a certain development, what remains is Hunham, smart but troubled Angus Tully (first timer Dominic Sessa) and the school's head cook, Mary Lamb (a divine Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019). Hunham is perpetually annoyed and has a weakness for booze. Angus is frustrated that his mother left him at school so she could travel with her new husband, and Mary is grieving over her son who was killed in Vietnam. Watching these three struggle to bond is a case study in psychology, yet of course we know they will ultimately form a family of misfits, depending on each other to offset the loneliness.The genius tagline for the film is ""Discomfort and Joy"", and initially the first overshadows the latter. Isolated from the world in their own way, the three characters begin to influence each other, showing broken/wounded people need and deserve love and friendship as much as anyone else. ""Entre nous"" (just between us) becomes a kind of calling card for this trio, and a Christmas party thrown by an eternally optimistic staffer (Carrie Preston) is a turning point.Giamatti is master of this material and only goes over the top a time or two. It's painful and humorous each time he is so anxious to infuse his breadth of ancient civilization facts into even the most mundane conversations. Newcomer Sessa possesses star potential and nails a complex first role. Da'Vine Joy Randolph's Mary is the heart of the film, doling out advice to Hunham and comfort to Angus. Depression is a vein running through these characters and it's acknowledged, though not the focus.This is Alexander Payne's first film since the disappointing DOWNSIZING (2017), but his brilliance has been proven in ABOUT SCHMIDT (2002), SIDEWAYS (2004), THE DESCENDANTS (2011), and NEBRASKA (2013). This time he's working from a screenplay by successful TV writer, David Hemingson, and though there is never much suspense about where the story or characters are headed, we enjoy the ride immensely. Cinematography from Eigil Byrld (IN BRUGES, 2008), perfectly complements the emotions (shot on digital, graininess added in post), and the soundtrack is period-specific, including the great Cat Stevens. Pay attention to the retro opening credits and logos, and enjoy a smart and funny film (an Alexander Payne trademark).Opening in theaters November 10, 2023."
"The Holdovers","akcenat","1 January 2024",810,"""The Holdovers"" is a captivating blend of comedy and drama that beautifully explores the complexities of human relationships.Story is about a grumpy instructor (Paul Giamatti) at a New England prep school who forms an unexpected bond with a troubled student during the Christmas break. Because it is set in the 1970s, the film in a way is a nostalgic journey back in time, but with a narrative that is both engaging and thought-provoking.The performances are exceptional, with Giamatti delivering a compelling portrayal of a man grappling with his own loneliness and the challenges of mentorship. The film's narrative is richly layered, exploring themes of loneliness, friendship, and personal growth. It's a story that resonates, offering a poignant reflection on the human condition. The film's setting in the 1970s adds a layer of nostalgia, further enhancing the emotional depth of the narrative. Despite its lengthy runtime, ""The Holdovers"" mostly maintains a steady pace, balancing its dramatic elements with moments of humor and warmth. The main plus of the movie is its dialogue-driven approach that adds to its charm, creating a sense of authenticity and depth in its character interactions.Overall, this is a film that leaves a lasting impression, offering a thoughtful exploration of human relationships set against the backdrop of a bygone era. With its exceptional performances and engaging narrative, I'm giving it an 8 out of 10 rating. It's a must-watch for those seeking a film that combines drama, comedy, and a touch of nostalgia."
"The Holdovers","Quinoa1984","30 October 2023",1010,"The Holdovers is, for all of the character dynamics and dysfunction and depression and other things we find out about the leads, mostly with Mr. Hunham and Angus and how their characters over these couple of weeks turn away from the ""Barton"" way of not telling lies (because, well, sometimes context and the moment matter for telling a lie that won't really hurt, maybe), a strangely comforting film to watch. Not for all of that exactly, though what we understand slowly but surely is this is all material for comedy and tragedy in equal measure, but because of the feeling that we get with a filmmaker who is so primed and confident with material that you don't feel like it can go wrong.What is more impressive is that, as enjoyable as the first half is, it is in the ""I like this"" mode as we are introduced to this world and Hunham and Angus and Mary, but it doesn't feel so special. But I should have known Payne and writer David Hemingson were laying down the necessary groundwork for what comes the moment a) the majority of the other supporting characters leave for reasons I don't have to mention here, and b) then the characters go outside the Barton campus grounds on a holiday party and then a ""field trip"" to Boston, you get the sense moment by moment and interaction by interaction it is so sharp and cutting and wise, and one scene in particular makes the jump into ""oh, OK, this is taking off into another level of personal pain and about familial expectations and what will come with in a life measuring up to others - and why that is wrong - and... yeah, it's great"" territory.In other words, it's the kind of film I want to watch again right away simply because now that I know a little more about the characters, I'll want to experience all of the extra textures (its 1970 down to the wood paneling and the car seats), and dig a little more into those absolutely wonderful natural restrained and complete performances - we take Giamatti for granted sometimes and this is a character he should be proud of to craft, lazy-ass eyes and all; Sessa's first role and he is an immediate star; I can't be more sure of anything for the next Oscar's that, if Randolph is nominated, she will win, if nothing else for everything she does at the Christmas party scenes, and a moment looking over some objects in a room later on is so moving - and my comfort is in seeing Payne clearly loving directing this intimate character study where he can show what a comedically observant, quick witted, and heartbreaking story this all is.It's one of the best Christmas movies in several years, embodying many themes and ideals that fit like a 70s wool sweater, and I'm sure the first thing Payne must have thought after reading the script was ""whoa. This is gonna be the best Hal Ashby or Bob Rafelson movie never made... is 'The Last Holdover' too on the nose?"" Even Hunham would give this... a B+ probably (did he ever give As? Shrug)."
"The Holdovers","jjgonzalez-06426","31 October 2023",910,"Quite possibly one of the best Christmas films ever? I first saw Payne & Giamatti's previous film together, ""Sideways"" during my screenwriting training class, and it is one that I would think of for a while. Their new film, ""The Holdovers"", is hilarious, beautifully shot and acted, heartwarming, and has a great sense of grief and joy meshed together. Definitely leaning towards Randolph for Best Supporting Actress; her performance BLEW me away.Overall, I love these films. Light-hearted & comedic while also have a sense of darkness and a lot of heavy emotion to it. Definitely is one of the most heartfelt films of the year."
"The Holdovers","paul-allaer","20 November 2023",810,"As ""The Holdovers"" (2023 release; 133 min.) opens, it's 1970 and we are at the Barton HS boarding school in New England as the Fall semester wraps up. Paul Hunham, a teacher of classical studies and a curmudgeon, gets summoned by the head of school, and is told he will take charge of the 4 or 5 ""holdovers"", students who for one reason or another, cannot go home and need to stay at the boarding school for the entire Christmas break... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest from director Alexander Payne (""Sideways"", ""The Descendants""). Here he brings to the big screen what life is like in Fall of 1970 among a group of privileged HS students along with their testy classics teacher and a Black woman who runs the kitchen. On the surface of it all, this looks to be a terrible combination, but as the movie plays out, more and more is revealed. The movie is plot-heavy and I shan't say another word on that. Paul Giamatti, a regular of Payne's prior movie work, brings what I feel is one of his strongest movie roles ever. Da'Vine Joy Randolph is outstanding as the Black kitchen supervisor with a heavy heart. Dominic Sessa is frankly too old (33 in real life) to play the rebellious HS student Angus (17 in the movie), I mean, it's really really obvious. That said, Payne just hits all the right notes in this film, and this resonated with me on so many levels. Despite the serious undertones, there are quite a few funny moments in the movie as well.""The Holdovers"" premiered a few months ago at the Telluride film festival to immediate and widespread critical acclaim. There is good reason why this is currently rated 87% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. The movie opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati the weekend before last. The early Sunday evening screening where I saw this at was attended so-so (about 12-15 people). If you are in the mood for a top-notch comedy drama, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion."
"The Holdovers","imseeg","14 December 2023",610,"I am big fan of director Alexander Payne (The Descendants, Sideways) and of actor Paul Giamatti in particular. Both have teamed up before with marvellous results, but this movie has got 1 problem that made me only rate it with 6 stars though:The bad:the middle part of this story stretches out too long, with several quite tedious scenes, which could have easily been cut out of it without hurting the storyline. I started watching at my watch half way through several times because of this lack of spark and punch. Such a pity!Fortunately this movie picked up momentum again towards the warmhearted Christmas spirited final, but I still will only award this movie with 6 stars (instead of 7) because I got bored at many moments during the somewhat tedious and long middle part.The story: It's about a young student and his teacher, who both are lonely souls and although they cant stand each other at first, eventually slowly do bond with each other during a Christmas holiday. Acting by Paul Giamatti is masterful (as always), BUT some of the other actors fail to impress me.Not the best of director Alexander Payne's work, but definitely still worth a watch, because it left me in my seat with a smile on my face and a feel good Christmas spirit of caring for one another!"
"The Holdovers","cparousis-30615","1 January 2024",1010,"Sad, poignant, funny, and beautiful are words that best describe this film. If this film doesn't make you feel sone kind of emotion, you are absolutely heartless. You love these characters. You feel for them on every single level. The film itself feels like a film from the 70s. The twists and turns the film takes are wonderful and heartwarming/heartbreaking. Paul Giamatti is excellent as always. This is Dominic Sessa's first film and he does an outstanding job. No crazy special effects or bloated explosions. Just great filmmaking. It's streaming on Peacock. An absolute holiday must. Take the time to watch it. You'll love it."
"The Holdovers","arfdawg-1","26 December 2023",510,"Lots of great reviews here. Many people who have seen Sideways seem to be excited that Giamatti has re-teamed with Payne the director.Of course, the film is in no way related to the other movie, except that both were involved and that Sideways has quite a cult following.Unfortunately this is not my type of movie. I'm not saying it's bad. And I'm not saying anything bad about the people who seem to love it. It's just not for me.It's a character driven movie, which is fine, except I didnt bond with any of the characters. And I found the choice of musical tunes throughout to be annoying at best.So if you like drawn out period piece character driven flicks, you may like this one. I didn't love it, but I could see how some might, hence the ""5"" rating."
"The Holdovers","kevin_robbins","31 December 2023",910,"My wife and I watched The Holdovers (2023) on Peacock last night. The storyline unfolds at a boarding school in Massachusetts during holiday vacation, focusing on the kids with nowhere to go for the holidays and the staff assigned to care for them, who happen to be facing a similar issue. Together, they work to uncover inner demons and find a way to release them, allowing everyone to truly enjoy the holiday season.Directed by Alexander Payne (Sideways), the film stars Paul Giamatti (American Splendor), Da'Vine Joy Randolph (Dolemite is my Name), Dominic Sessa, and Carrie Preston (Claws).This is an exceptionally unique holiday film, offering intriguing settings, characters, and circumstances. All facets are fascinating and worthwhile, with outstanding writing that establishes the storyline and various subplots effectively. The dialogue is absolutely superb, featuring a well-balanced blend of raw emotion, character development, and comedy. The eyebrow-raising conclusion is perfect for the characters' concluding direction.In conclusion, The Holdovers is a unique and captivating character piece that's an absolute must-see. I would score this a 9/10 and strongly recommend it."
"The Holdovers","euroGary","19 October 2023",1010,"One does not expect a Christmas film to be challenging, and this one certainly isn't. But it is a lot of fun.A boys' boarding school empties of almost all staff and pupils for the 1970/1 Festive Season. Left behind are Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti), the unpopular history teacher who has to keep an eye on the school; Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa), a teenaged pupil whose mother does not want him on her honeymoon; and Mary Lamb (the impressively-named Da'Vine Joy Randolph), the school cook who is facing her first Christmas alone since her son died on military service. As these three lonely souls come together, there are tantrums, emotional revelations, the revealing of long-hidden secrets, a noble sacrifice... the usual stuff.Also the usual stuff are the characters: Paul is cynical and frustrated; Angus is ironic and insecure; and as Mary is overweight and black, she of course has to be sassy.But while in some films such predictability would be annoying, it works here. Within the limits of their somewhat two-dimensional personalities, the characters are well-written - even Angus' tantrums do not seem unreasonable. Plus, there are some great gags (""You hit him? You mean you punched him out?"" ""No, I hit him with a car..."") And I will not be the only viewer who finishes the film with a lump in his throat.Great fun. I can easily see myself buying the DVD and watching this for many Christmases to come..."
"The Holdovers","cherold","31 December 2023",810,"This movie is about a handful of entitled boys who regretfully must stay behind during the Christmas break at their private school and the teacher and cook there to oversee them.It's a funny and affecting movie with excellent performances from the leads, especially Paul giamatti as the prickly teacher.It's a Christmas movie of sorts, since it does take place at Christmas, but it's really more of an anytime of the year film in which you get to see people have adventures and fight and grow and that sort of thing.It's very well filmed, it's very entertaining, and I would recommend you watch it."
"The Holdovers","bastille-852-731547","29 October 2023",610,"Set in December 1970, ""The Holdovers"" follows a small group of students who have to stay on campus over the Christmas break at Barton Academy (a prestigious boarding school in Massachusetts,) alongside a curmudgeonly ancient history teacher (Paul Giamatti.) That sounds like a potentially amusing premise for a breezy comedy-drama, especially when Alexander Payne is directing. Having greatly enjoyed and admired several of Payne's previous films such as ""Sideways,"" ""The Descendants,"" and ""Nebraska,"" I was looking forward to this film. Overall, I found it to be simply fine and not up to par with the level of quality of most of Payne's films. There's nothing too wrong with it by any stretch of the imagination, but it's often generic and forgettable compared to Payne's other films.An indie dramedy like this film would generally be expected to be defined by being character- and writing-driven. Unfortunately, neither the characters nor the writing here are especially unique enough to structure a compelling plot around. Paul (Giamatti's character) is very generic, as is the rebellious student Angus, whose relationship with Paul is a pivotal part of the film. On a better note, Da'Vine Joy Randolph gives a strong and impactful performance as Mary, a cafeteria worker dealing with bereavement; her character is interestingly more dynamic and multi-dimensional than either Paul or Angus. The writing and humor is less unique, funny, or engaging than many of Payne's films, as the attempts at plot devices, character development, and humor often boil down to insult comedy between Paul and Angus--which, ultimately, wears out its welcome a bit, and actually causes a bit of collateral damage in making the film's tone and story feel less sincere. Regardless of the sincerity of the story, another thing that is clear here is that there needed to be a stronger and less predictable core to the plot in order for the film to remain engaging for its 133-minute runtime.The film's retro, 1970s-aesthetic is commendable and helps contribute to the atmosphere of the film, and there still are some sporadic sweet moments of Paul and Mary hanging out around the television and a few decent jokes here and there. So ""The Holdovers"" is a fine enough film, but it won't be a new holiday classic for me. 6/10."
"The Holdovers","RahulM007","31 October 2023",1010,"""Penis cancer in human form.""Alexander Payne's ""The Holdovers"" is a laugh-out-loud comedy strengthened by Paul Giamatti and Dominic Sessa's magnetic performances and their incredible chemistry together. I am in awe by the film's brilliant and inventive screenplay, 70s-style cinematography, slick editing, and great production design. I could watch Paul and Angus bicker for another two hours. Throughout the film, the humour gets more interwoven leading to a crescendo of hilarity. ""The Holdovers"" offers the perfect blend of humor and pathos.*That waitress was so rude for refusing to accept their order of cherries jubilee. She is a fascist and a ""penis cancer in human form"".*The film reminded me of Peter Weir's ""Dead Poets Society"", Milos Forman's ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", and John Hughes' ""The Breakfast Club"" (kind of).Final verdict: 10/10."
"The Holdovers","Avwillfan89","29 November 2023",910,"Finally, Alexander Payne has made a worthy follow up to his (in my opinion at least) masterpiece Sideways.I really related so much to all three of the main characters, who all come from different backgrounds. Paul Giamatti, brilliant in almost anything he does, plays a grumpy, alcoholic, sour professor who does not suffer fools and doesn't cut his privileged students any slack. Dominic Sessa is troubled teen with a dysfunctional family and mental issues. D'Avine Joy Randolf is a grieving mother stuck in a job wanting to make ends meet for her family, by her choice.This movie has great character development, a wholesome story with flawed yet lovable characters you can root for and terrific, funny dialogue. Simple, yet perfect. 9 out of 10."
"The Holdovers","frankde-jong","27 December 2023",910,"I had a lot of associations when I started watching ""The holdovers"".Kids stuck in a school during the Christmas vacation, is that not a little bit like ""The breakfast club"" (1985, John Hughes)? No, because most of the kids go away early in the film and we are left with just one pupil (Angus Tully played by Dominic Sessa) and a teacher (Paul Hunham played by Paul Giamatti).Paul Hunham teaches ancient languages and culture. Does that sounds like the Donna Tartt novel ""The secret history"" (1992)? No, in that novel the pupils are inspired by their teacher. In ""The holdovers"" the teacher is hated.One association that I did not have at all prior to watching the movie may be the most accurate: ""Scent of a woman"" (1992, Martin Brest). Also in this film a high school pupil on an expensive boarding school and a grumpy old man are condemned to each other.Best of all however we can see ""The holdovers"" as the comeback of Alexander Payne after his failed film ""Downsizing"" (2017). The film is situated in 1970 and has a very 70's look and feel, down to the aspect ratio then used. The film also contains very beautiful images of Norteast American landscapes.First of all however the film is about its three main characters. Apart from the two already introduced we have the chief cook of the boarding school Mary Lamb (Da'Vine Joy Randolph). These three people form a sort of substitute family that has to spend the Christmas season together. Each of them has his/her problems but during the film they grow closer to each other, or at least learn to understand each other better.Being a Christmas movie you expect a happy ending and somewhere in the middle of the film this happy ending seems to consist of all the members of the proxy family being on their way towards an unexpected romance. The greatness of the film is that these romances do not materialize fully. The message of the film seems to be that gaining better understanding is a happy enough ending.By the way the film does not shy away from some social criticism. The character of Paul Hunham is meant to be grumpy at first, but to me he was instantly sympathetic when he made the headmaster of the boarding school very clear that in his class wealthy parents could not buy good grades for their sons. Later he says to his pupils (at that stage of the film there are still a couple of them) that they ought to be aware of their privileged status. ""You go to Harvard, poorer boys go to Vietnam"". The Vietnam war plays an important role in the background anyway. The son of the chief cook has died in Vietnam and while visiting a bar in the village nearby the boarding school there is a local boy that lost one of his hands in Vietnam.All in all ""The holdovers"" is a very convincing comeback of Alexander Payne. He made an instant Christmas classic!"
"The Holdovers","210west","14 January 2024",410,"Alexander Payne's 1999 comedy ""Election,"" set in a Midwestern high school, was brilliant, sometimes painful, sometimes hilarious. Best of all (I say this as a onetime high school teacher), it felt refreshingly authentic.""The Holdovers"" is quite the opposite: contrived, predictable, and intended to teach -- you guessed it -- a little lesson in compassion. An hour into it, I realized that it hadn't yet contained a single moment that seemed genuine, much less surprising. Every line of dialogue sounds phony. Characters speak in little announcements, spelling things out for us. Some of the characters -- a couple of menacing townies, for example -- are mere cartoons.Giamatti's protagonist is a wholly artificial creation, designed as if in a screenwriting course to follow the approved character arc -- initially stuffy and unsympathetic to the point of caricature, ultimately vulnerable. Ironically, an early scene between him and the school's headmaster violates what's sometimes regarded as a screenwriting rule: Do NOT, even in the interest of exposition, have people telling each other what they already know. (The by-the-numbers triteness of that conversation -- meant to show us that the instructor is uncompromising and pedantic but possesses old-fashioned integrity, blah blah blah -- put me off from the start.) The scenes between Giamatti and the school's cook -- in which, with the audience in mind, the two provide personal backstories and reveal their inner selves -- are painfully heavy-handed and at times so gooey that I felt sorry for the actress: ""You can't even dream a whole dream, can you?"" she is made to say at one point. ""What are you afraid of?""Yes, I know, everybody seems to love the movie. I could barely stomach it. But do check out ""Election."""
"The Holdovers","bdesdes","30 October 2023",810,"Very enjoyable film with outstanding performances and a wonderful warm vibe accompanied by the Christmas season. It's funny at times, sad at times, and feel-good. It's a story that almost all can relate to and will really touch your heart. It deals with so many themes, but mainly grief, the past, family, and what makes a person who they are. It's also very original and has a great script, cinematography, and soundtrack. I would highly advise to see it in the theaters as well as you really get the 70's vibe and deep moment on the big screen. There aren't many negatives to this film and I would recommend it to most people."

The Holdovers is a strong and warm-hearted piece that gives actors roles with powerful lines, without any reliance on flashy editing and being overwhelmed by special effects.The story is simple three people get stuck for the Christmas holidays in a boarding school. It's cold, lonely, and boring for the parties involved. The adults drink to cope with whatever pressures they live with. The young man resorts to bad behavior and altercations with the teacher in charge.Through the vacation period these people will get to interact and get to know each other, something that will prove to a challenge to say the least. As the story evolves, we get to understand what has made the people who they are. We get to feel their pain and frustration through the very insightful writing of the director.It's a strong film with superb acting by the main leads. They have great chemistry together.Most outstanding is Paul Giamatti who plays the tormented and defensive man with relish and speaks volumes with his eyes.Hope the academy honors his performance as the best the year because no one else so far is coming close."
"The Holdovers","darkreignn","29 October 2023",910,"Let's just get this out of the way now - when it comes to writing this review, I'm probably a little bit biased (and a little bit drunk, currently, but that's besides the point). You see, I have an affinity for indie coming of age movies, and ""The Holdovers"" is basically an indie coming of age film, so it may - or may not - come as a surprise to you that I absolutely adored this picture. So, with that little preface out of the way, it's time for me to gush over this movie.Starring none other than Paul Giamatti as Paul Hunham, Giamatti plays a professor at an all boys boarding school where, over Christmas break, he has the misfortune of looking over a group of boys, one of whom is named Angus, played by Dominic Sessa. After a rocky start, where Paul clearly doesn't get along with any of the boys, making his disdain clear and evident, he eventually finds himself alone with Angus - as well as with the school's cook, Mary Lamb, played by Da'Vine Joy Randolph - in an unexpected chain of events. What occurs after is a slice-of-life style piece of cinema that allows broken people to find comfort in each other's company.""The Holdovers"" is, without a doubt, one of my favorite movies of 2023, as well as probably one of the best movies of the year, as well. This Christmas-themed gem doesn't hold back on the drama, delivering a thoughtful blend of comedy, coming-of-age storytelling, and a touch of romance - all wrapped around a very raw, human plot-line that virtually everyone can relate to. I'm no spring chicken myself, but I found myself deeply connected to both main characters - one who is older and basically dejected with life as he knows it, and one who is younger but who feels lost, aimless, and disconnected from both family and friends. And admittedly, not everyone will have a direct parallel to these experiences, but even if you don't, you're in for a story that's bound to tug at your heartstrings... and make you laugh out loud in the process.This is a high-quality movie - from the impeccable acting to the beautiful on-location cinematography to the relatable, thought-provoking plot, every element is executed with pinpoint precision and finesse; it's a testament to the art of storytelling on the silver screen. Director Alexander Payne knows how to create an artful film, and ""The Holdovers"" is no exception. It's at once indie and art-house while simultaneously being mainstream and easily accessible; in short, it's a film for everyone that actually feels like a genuine crowdpleaser instead of a pandering mess.I'm having a difficult time describing what I liked about this movie, and the reason is because I liked almost everything about this movie. So why the 9 out of 10 rating instead of the perfect 10? Literally the only thing that's holding me back is because I would've liked a touch more romance; yes, there was romance here, but a bit more would've pushed me over the edge into 10 out of 10 territory. Besides that, this is basically a perfect film, one that I loved, and one that has become one of my favorite movies of the year, if not of all time. I am genuinely looking forward to rewatching this, and I can't wait until it becomes closer to Christmas so I can view this on my own TV, cuddled under blankets, with a glass of whiskey, and bask in the absolute heartwarming experience that is ""The Holdovers."" My recommendation: Do yourself a favor and watch this as soon as you can - you won't regret it."
"The Holdovers","evanston_dad","20 November 2023",1010,"Mid-way through ""The Holdovers,"" I started openly weeping in the movie theater, and I pretty much kept it up on and off for the rest of the movie. Sometimes, there wasn't even anything obviously sad or moving happening in the scene, and I still couldn't stop. I think it's because this movie is so kind, and kindness is a rare commodity these days. It's sad to think that a movie about characters learning to have compassion for each other and for the hardships they've been through should feel like such a rare beast, but here we are.This is Alexander Payne firing on all cylinders as a director, and though he didn't write this movie, it feels like he could have. It's an obvious throwback to the kinds of movies Hal Ashby made throughout the 1970s and is touching in exactly the same way ""Harold and Maude"" was. It's also a master class in acting from the three principal characters played by Paul Giamatti, Dominic Sessa, and Da 'Vine Joy Randolph, and I hope all three of them, and the movie overall, is remembered come Oscar time.This will easily make my top ten list for the year.Grade: A+"
"The Holdovers","Xstal","28 November 2023",810,"Now here's a film with a life affirming theme, that should encourage most viewers to think of their dreams, and cascade away all their cloaks, inhibitions, and open fresh doors to their heart's intuitions; as a teacher whose life is as stale as dead fish, whose life is the opposite of happy and bliss, meets a boy who's ignored by all those he holds dear, and a friendship is formed that is warm and sincere; it's a subtle reflection of how we get trapped, by tradition and habits and past circumstance, where surroundings like prisons can temper our thinking, to distil all our spirit, to bottles for drinking; so embrace all the chances when they come along, break out of that mould and sing your own song, open your eyes to the paths unexplored, take a stand and stand tall, and stop being ignored."
"The Holdovers","steiner-sam","10 November 2023",910,"It's a comedy-drama set from December 16, 1970, to the first week of January 1971 in an exclusive boy's boarding school in New England and Boston, Massachusetts. It follows the experiences of the ""holdovers,"" that is, the students who cannot go home over the Christmas holidays and the two Barton staff left to supervise them during the holidays.There are five holdovers: Teddy Kountze (Brady Hepner), Jason Smith (Michael Provost), and Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa) are upper-class wealthy WASP students. Alex Ollerman (Ian Dolley) is a younger Mormon student whose parents are on a mission in South America. Ye-Joon Park (Jim Kaplan) is from South Korea.Left to supervise is Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti), an unmarried ancient history teacher who was once a student at Barton and has taught there all his career. He's a demanding curmudgeon who almost everyone dislikes. African American Mary Lamb (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), the head cook, is also present; her son, a Barton grad, has just been killed in Vietnam.The film follows the shared experiences of the holdovers, though four students leave after a week when a wealthy father takes them for a ski holiday. Paul cannot contact Angus's parents, so he must stay with Paul and Mary at Barton. We also meet the school's headmaster, Hardy Woodrup (Andrew Garman), his administrative assistant, Lydia Crane (Carrie Preston), and janitor Danny (Naheem Garcia).""The Holdovers"" is a delightful comedy leavened with wisdom as we learn the dark secrets that have shaped Paul Hunham and Angus Tully. Giamatti, Sessa, and Randolph are all excellent. The script unfolds the twists and turns superbly. ""The Holdovers"" is a great Christmas movie."
"The Holdovers","JohnDeSando","16 November 2023",NA,"""I find the world a bitter and complicated place. And it seems to feel the same way about me."" Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti)Teaching privileged boys at an elite new England prep school called Barton (think for example, Philips Exeter), might be the pinnacle of an academic's career. But not Paul Hunham in The Holdovers, an elite movie itself of the year.Paul should be teaching classics at an ivy school, not teaching entitled ""vermin,"" among the many sobriquets he tosses around about the fortunate young men to experience his brand of grumpy intellectualism and misanthropy. He prepares them for a world that won't always be coddling and protecting them as their family wealth so naturally does in their early years.Director Alexander Payne worked with Giamatti in Sideways, so he is prepared to have another winning cynical character who is endearing while distanced by negative temperament from normally positive fellow humans (Paul's last name, Hunham, suggests a distant connection with the better angels of humanity).As Paul accepts the assignment to supervise holdovers (exiled to Christmas vacation in the absence of parents or guardians), the number whittles down to just Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa, reminiscent of young, Timothy Chalamet and Adam Driver), who shares Paul's dark attitudes and, with the sharp writing of David Hemingson, some witty dialogue- e.g., about Paul he says, ""I thought all of the Nazis had left for Argentina.""Although, as in likeminded dramas such as Dead Poet's Society or Goodbye, Mr. Chips, the principals are destined to be transformed into more humane characters, Holdovers continues, even in its denouement, to accentuate the unsunny side of life for Paul and Tully, whose fortunes are still compromised by cold-hearted parents and administrators. The chilly world, however, is warmed on these lovely, snowbound days, by women, viz., the cook, Mary (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) and administrator Lydia (Carrie Preston).Mary good-naturedly deals with the death of her son, Curtis, a Barton grad who had to join the military because he did not have the resources as other Barton grads of the late '60s did to avoid the draft.Lydia, an attractive middle-aged staff member, holds the promise of a love interest for Paul, only to show how difficult it is for social exiles to enter the romantic mainstream.The Holdovers is a small gem of a move that will immediately remind buffs about Hal Ashby comedies of the same era like Harold & Maude, where character development is paramount and detachment from the mainstream is required to look at humanity clearly with its foibles and endearments.The Holdovers is a movie everyone can enjoy with endearing characters who share with us our moments about loneliness peppered with the possibilities of love and happiness.""Do you think I want to be babysitting you? No. I was praying your mother would pick up the phone, or your father would arrive in a helicopter or a flying saucer...."" Paul Hunham."
"The Holdovers","dtswpod","6 November 2023",810,"Do you miss how they used to make films in the 1970s? Plenty of filmmakers do, except they take that nostalgia and just do watered down versions of better movies. As an example see Taxi Driver and King of Comedy then watch Joker and you'll get what I mean.Thankfully, Alexander Payne has managed to take his sentimentality and make an original film out of it. Or if The Holdovers is a pale imitation of a superior picture then the filmmaker has managed to trick me because I don't feel as if I've seen this movie before but done better.Now to be clear, there aren't things you've never seen before in the movie. I mean, you know the characters are going to bond at some point. And people will grow to care about each other. That's a given. How we get there, however, is what makes the film seem fresh and entertaining and ever bit as good as any flick made back in the day.I hope more people see it."
"The Holdovers","tdwillis-26273","7 December 2023",810,"Finally......a GOOD movie. The story/script, although not a breakthrough idea, was heartfelt,full and real.The settings were also real and gorgeous (not really a cgi fan)
Camera, cinematography, lighting,sound,score....every level made my eyes and ears satisfyingly full.Acting was oscarworthy across the board.Directing was brilliant.Only negative I can come up with is that the pace was a bit slow, but so much of the movie is so focused and so superbly and beautifully made I just sat back and enjoyed it.A very thoughtful substantial and beautiful movie. A rare gem in today's superficial gimmicky movie making world."
"The Holdovers","ferguson-6","8 November 2023",810,"Greetings again from the darkness. We've all had that teacher. You know, the one with an evil streak who just seemed to thrive on making students miserable. Throw in a staff and administrators who feel the same way, and the casting choice for the teacher becomes obvious. Enter the always great and perfectly curmudgeonly Paul Giamatti. This is the first time Giamatti has worked with two-time Oscar winner Alexander Payne since their brilliant SIDEWAYS (2004), and it's clear these two share a wavelength for comedy and drama, even in throwback form.Paul Hunham (Giamatti) is a long-time professor at Barton Academy, an all-boys private prep school located in the snowy northeast. It's December 1970, and an early scene exemplifies how he relishes the failing grades he bestows upon desperate students so afraid to disappoint their rich parents. In the final class before the holiday break, the student-teacher banter doesn't go so well for the boys, and they head to break with an extra workload. Hunham is easily manipulated into babysitting the titular holdovers - students stuck at school over the break, while most others spend time with family, often on exotic trips.Initially there are five students, but after a certain development, what remains is Hunham, smart but troubled Angus Tully (first timer Dominic Sessa) and the school's head cook, Mary Lamb (a divine Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019). Hunham is perpetually annoyed and has a weakness for booze. Angus is frustrated that his mother left him at school so she could travel with her new husband, and Mary is grieving over her son who was killed in Vietnam. Watching these three struggle to bond is a case study in psychology, yet of course we know they will ultimately form a family of misfits, depending on each other to offset the loneliness.The genius tagline for the film is ""Discomfort and Joy"", and initially the first overshadows the latter. Isolated from the world in their own way, the three characters begin to influence each other, showing broken/wounded people need and deserve love and friendship as much as anyone else. ""Entre nous"" (just between us) becomes a kind of calling card for this trio, and a Christmas party thrown by an eternally optimistic staffer (Carrie Preston) is a turning point.Giamatti is master of this material and only goes over the top a time or two. It's painful and humorous each time he is so anxious to infuse his breadth of ancient civilization facts into even the most mundane conversations. Newcomer Sessa possesses star potential and nails a complex first role. Da'Vine Joy Randolph's Mary is the heart of the film, doling out advice to Hunham and comfort to Angus. Depression is a vein running through these characters and it's acknowledged, though not the focus.This is Alexander Payne's first film since the disappointing DOWNSIZING (2017), but his brilliance has been proven in ABOUT SCHMIDT (2002), SIDEWAYS (2004), THE DESCENDANTS (2011), and NEBRASKA (2013). This time he's working from a screenplay by successful TV writer, David Hemingson, and though there is never much suspense about where the story or characters are headed, we enjoy the ride immensely. Cinematography from Eigil Byrld (IN BRUGES, 2008), perfectly complements the emotions (shot on digital, graininess added in post), and the soundtrack is period-specific, including the great Cat Stevens. Pay attention to the retro opening credits and logos, and enjoy a smart and funny film (an Alexander Payne trademark).Opening in theaters November 10, 2023."
"The Holdovers","akcenat","1 January 2024",810,"""The Holdovers"" is a captivating blend of comedy and drama that beautifully explores the complexities of human relationships.Story is about a grumpy instructor (Paul Giamatti) at a New England prep school who forms an unexpected bond with a troubled student during the Christmas break. Because it is set in the 1970s, the film in a way is a nostalgic journey back in time, but with a narrative that is both engaging and thought-provoking.The performances are exceptional, with Giamatti delivering a compelling portrayal of a man grappling with his own loneliness and the challenges of mentorship. The film's narrative is richly layered, exploring themes of loneliness, friendship, and personal growth. It's a story that resonates, offering a poignant reflection on the human condition. The film's setting in the 1970s adds a layer of nostalgia, further enhancing the emotional depth of the narrative. Despite its lengthy runtime, ""The Holdovers"" mostly maintains a steady pace, balancing its dramatic elements with moments of humor and warmth. The main plus of the movie is its dialogue-driven approach that adds to its charm, creating a sense of authenticity and depth in its character interactions.Overall, this is a film that leaves a lasting impression, offering a thoughtful exploration of human relationships set against the backdrop of a bygone era. With its exceptional performances and engaging narrative, I'm giving it an 8 out of 10 rating. It's a must-watch for those seeking a film that combines drama, comedy, and a touch of nostalgia."
"The Holdovers","Quinoa1984","30 October 2023",1010,"The Holdovers is, for all of the character dynamics and dysfunction and depression and other things we find out about the leads, mostly with Mr. Hunham and Angus and how their characters over these couple of weeks turn away from the ""Barton"" way of not telling lies (because, well, sometimes context and the moment matter for telling a lie that won't really hurt, maybe), a strangely comforting film to watch. Not for all of that exactly, though what we understand slowly but surely is this is all material for comedy and tragedy in equal measure, but because of the feeling that we get with a filmmaker who is so primed and confident with material that you don't feel like it can go wrong.What is more impressive is that, as enjoyable as the first half is, it is in the ""I like this"" mode as we are introduced to this world and Hunham and Angus and Mary, but it doesn't feel so special. But I should have known Payne and writer David Hemingson were laying down the necessary groundwork for what comes the moment a) the majority of the other supporting characters leave for reasons I don't have to mention here, and b) then the characters go outside the Barton campus grounds on a holiday party and then a ""field trip"" to Boston, you get the sense moment by moment and interaction by interaction it is so sharp and cutting and wise, and one scene in particular makes the jump into ""oh, OK, this is taking off into another level of personal pain and about familial expectations and what will come with in a life measuring up to others - and why that is wrong - and... yeah, it's great"" territory.In other words, it's the kind of film I want to watch again right away simply because now that I know a little more about the characters, I'll want to experience all of the extra textures (its 1970 down to the wood paneling and the car seats), and dig a little more into those absolutely wonderful natural restrained and complete performances - we take Giamatti for granted sometimes and this is a character he should be proud of to craft, lazy-ass eyes and all; Sessa's first role and he is an immediate star; I can't be more sure of anything for the next Oscar's that, if Randolph is nominated, she will win, if nothing else for everything she does at the Christmas party scenes, and a moment looking over some objects in a room later on is so moving - and my comfort is in seeing Payne clearly loving directing this intimate character study where he can show what a comedically observant, quick witted, and heartbreaking story this all is.It's one of the best Christmas movies in several years, embodying many themes and ideals that fit like a 70s wool sweater, and I'm sure the first thing Payne must have thought after reading the script was ""whoa. This is gonna be the best Hal Ashby or Bob Rafelson movie never made... is 'The Last Holdover' too on the nose?"" Even Hunham would give this... a B+ probably (did he ever give As? Shrug)."
"The Holdovers","jjgonzalez-06426","31 October 2023",910,"Quite possibly one of the best Christmas films ever? I first saw Payne & Giamatti's previous film together, ""Sideways"" during my screenwriting training class, and it is one that I would think of for a while. Their new film, ""The Holdovers"", is hilarious, beautifully shot and acted, heartwarming, and has a great sense of grief and joy meshed together. Definitely leaning towards Randolph for Best Supporting Actress; her performance BLEW me away.Overall, I love these films. Light-hearted & comedic while also have a sense of darkness and a lot of heavy emotion to it. Definitely is one of the most heartfelt films of the year."
"The Holdovers","paul-allaer","20 November 2023",810,"As ""The Holdovers"" (2023 release; 133 min.) opens, it's 1970 and we are at the Barton HS boarding school in New England as the Fall semester wraps up. Paul Hunham, a teacher of classical studies and a curmudgeon, gets summoned by the head of school, and is told he will take charge of the 4 or 5 ""holdovers"", students who for one reason or another, cannot go home and need to stay at the boarding school for the entire Christmas break... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest from director Alexander Payne (""Sideways"", ""The Descendants""). Here he brings to the big screen what life is like in Fall of 1970 among a group of privileged HS students along with their testy classics teacher and a Black woman who runs the kitchen. On the surface of it all, this looks to be a terrible combination, but as the movie plays out, more and more is revealed. The movie is plot-heavy and I shan't say another word on that. Paul Giamatti, a regular of Payne's prior movie work, brings what I feel is one of his strongest movie roles ever. Da'Vine Joy Randolph is outstanding as the Black kitchen supervisor with a heavy heart. Dominic Sessa is frankly too old (33 in real life) to play the rebellious HS student Angus (17 in the movie), I mean, it's really really obvious. That said, Payne just hits all the right notes in this film, and this resonated with me on so many levels. Despite the serious undertones, there are quite a few funny moments in the movie as well.""The Holdovers"" premiered a few months ago at the Telluride film festival to immediate and widespread critical acclaim. There is good reason why this is currently rated 87% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. The movie opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati the weekend before last. The early Sunday evening screening where I saw this at was attended so-so (about 12-15 people). If you are in the mood for a top-notch comedy drama, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion."
"The Holdovers","imseeg","14 December 2023",610,"I am big fan of director Alexander Payne (The Descendants, Sideways) and of actor Paul Giamatti in particular. Both have teamed up before with marvellous results, but this movie has got 1 problem that made me only rate it with 6 stars though:The bad:the middle part of this story stretches out too long, with several quite tedious scenes, which could have easily been cut out of it without hurting the storyline. I started watching at my watch half way through several times because of this lack of spark and punch. Such a pity!Fortunately this movie picked up momentum again towards the warmhearted Christmas spirited final, but I still will only award this movie with 6 stars (instead of 7) because I got bored at many moments during the somewhat tedious and long middle part.The story: It's about a young student and his teacher, who both are lonely souls and although they cant stand each other at first, eventually slowly do bond with each other during a Christmas holiday. Acting by Paul Giamatti is masterful (as always), BUT some of the other actors fail to impress me.Not the best of director Alexander Payne's work, but definitely still worth a watch, because it left me in my seat with a smile on my face and a feel good Christmas spirit of caring for one another!"
"The Holdovers","cparousis-30615","1 January 2024",1010,"Sad, poignant, funny, and beautiful are words that best describe this film. If this film doesn't make you feel sone kind of emotion, you are absolutely heartless. You love these characters. You feel for them on every single level. The film itself feels like a film from the 70s. The twists and turns the film takes are wonderful and heartwarming/heartbreaking. Paul Giamatti is excellent as always. This is Dominic Sessa's first film and he does an outstanding job. No crazy special effects or bloated explosions. Just great filmmaking. It's streaming on Peacock. An absolute holiday must. Take the time to watch it. You'll love it."
"The Holdovers","arfdawg-1","26 December 2023",510,"Lots of great reviews here. Many people who have seen Sideways seem to be excited that Giamatti has re-teamed with Payne the director.Of course, the film is in no way related to the other movie, except that both were involved and that Sideways has quite a cult following.Unfortunately this is not my type of movie. I'm not saying it's bad. And I'm not saying anything bad about the people who seem to love it. It's just not for me.It's a character driven movie, which is fine, except I didnt bond with any of the characters. And I found the choice of musical tunes throughout to be annoying at best.So if you like drawn out period piece character driven flicks, you may like this one. I didn't love it, but I could see how some might, hence the ""5"" rating."
"The Holdovers","kevin_robbins","31 December 2023",910,"My wife and I watched The Holdovers (2023) on Peacock last night. The storyline unfolds at a boarding school in Massachusetts during holiday vacation, focusing on the kids with nowhere to go for the holidays and the staff assigned to care for them, who happen to be facing a similar issue. Together, they work to uncover inner demons and find a way to release them, allowing everyone to truly enjoy the holiday season.Directed by Alexander Payne (Sideways), the film stars Paul Giamatti (American Splendor), Da'Vine Joy Randolph (Dolemite is my Name), Dominic Sessa, and Carrie Preston (Claws).This is an exceptionally unique holiday film, offering intriguing settings, characters, and circumstances. All facets are fascinating and worthwhile, with outstanding writing that establishes the storyline and various subplots effectively. The dialogue is absolutely superb, featuring a well-balanced blend of raw emotion, character development, and comedy. The eyebrow-raising conclusion is perfect for the characters' concluding direction.In conclusion, The Holdovers is a unique and captivating character piece that's an absolute must-see. I would score this a 9/10 and strongly recommend it."
"The Holdovers","euroGary","19 October 2023",1010,"One does not expect a Christmas film to be challenging, and this one certainly isn't. But it is a lot of fun.A boys' boarding school empties of almost all staff and pupils for the 1970/1 Festive Season. Left behind are Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti), the unpopular history teacher who has to keep an eye on the school; Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa), a teenaged pupil whose mother does not want him on her honeymoon; and Mary Lamb (the impressively-named Da'Vine Joy Randolph), the school cook who is facing her first Christmas alone since her son died on military service. As these three lonely souls come together, there are tantrums, emotional revelations, the revealing of long-hidden secrets, a noble sacrifice... the usual stuff.Also the usual stuff are the characters: Paul is cynical and frustrated; Angus is ironic and insecure; and as Mary is overweight and black, she of course has to be sassy.But while in some films such predictability would be annoying, it works here. Within the limits of their somewhat two-dimensional personalities, the characters are well-written - even Angus' tantrums do not seem unreasonable. Plus, there are some great gags (""You hit him? You mean you punched him out?"" ""No, I hit him with a car..."") And I will not be the only viewer who finishes the film with a lump in his throat.Great fun. I can easily see myself buying the DVD and watching this for many Christmases to come..."
"The Holdovers","cherold","31 December 2023",810,"This movie is about a handful of entitled boys who regretfully must stay behind during the Christmas break at their private school and the teacher and cook there to oversee them.It's a funny and affecting movie with excellent performances from the leads, especially Paul giamatti as the prickly teacher.It's a Christmas movie of sorts, since it does take place at Christmas, but it's really more of an anytime of the year film in which you get to see people have adventures and fight and grow and that sort of thing.It's very well filmed, it's very entertaining, and I would recommend you watch it."
"The Holdovers","bastille-852-731547","29 October 2023",610,"Set in December 1970, ""The Holdovers"" follows a small group of students who have to stay on campus over the Christmas break at Barton Academy (a prestigious boarding school in Massachusetts,) alongside a curmudgeonly ancient history teacher (Paul Giamatti.) That sounds like a potentially amusing premise for a breezy comedy-drama, especially when Alexander Payne is directing. Having greatly enjoyed and admired several of Payne's previous films such as ""Sideways,"" ""The Descendants,"" and ""Nebraska,"" I was looking forward to this film. Overall, I found it to be simply fine and not up to par with the level of quality of most of Payne's films. There's nothing too wrong with it by any stretch of the imagination, but it's often generic and forgettable compared to Payne's other films.An indie dramedy like this film would generally be expected to be defined by being character- and writing-driven. Unfortunately, neither the characters nor the writing here are especially unique enough to structure a compelling plot around. Paul (Giamatti's character) is very generic, as is the rebellious student Angus, whose relationship with Paul is a pivotal part of the film. On a better note, Da'Vine Joy Randolph gives a strong and impactful performance as Mary, a cafeteria worker dealing with bereavement; her character is interestingly more dynamic and multi-dimensional than either Paul or Angus. The writing and humor is less unique, funny, or engaging than many of Payne's films, as the attempts at plot devices, character development, and humor often boil down to insult comedy between Paul and Angus--which, ultimately, wears out its welcome a bit, and actually causes a bit of collateral damage in making the film's tone and story feel less sincere. Regardless of the sincerity of the story, another thing that is clear here is that there needed to be a stronger and less predictable core to the plot in order for the film to remain engaging for its 133-minute runtime.The film's retro, 1970s-aesthetic is commendable and helps contribute to the atmosphere of the film, and there still are some sporadic sweet moments of Paul and Mary hanging out around the television and a few decent jokes here and there. So ""The Holdovers"" is a fine enough film, but it won't be a new holiday classic for me. 6/10."
"The Holdovers","RahulM007","31 October 2023",1010,"""Penis cancer in human form.""Alexander Payne's ""The Holdovers"" is a laugh-out-loud comedy strengthened by Paul Giamatti and Dominic Sessa's magnetic performances and their incredible chemistry together. I am in awe by the film's brilliant and inventive screenplay, 70s-style cinematography, slick editing, and great production design. I could watch Paul and Angus bicker for another two hours. Throughout the film, the humour gets more interwoven leading to a crescendo of hilarity. ""The Holdovers"" offers the perfect blend of humor and pathos.*That waitress was so rude for refusing to accept their order of cherries jubilee. She is a fascist and a ""penis cancer in human form"".*The film reminded me of Peter Weir's ""Dead Poets Society"", Milos Forman's ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", and John Hughes' ""The Breakfast Club"" (kind of).Final verdict: 10/10."
"The Holdovers","Avwillfan89","29 November 2023",910,"Finally, Alexander Payne has made a worthy follow up to his (in my opinion at least) masterpiece Sideways.I really related so much to all three of the main characters, who all come from different backgrounds. Paul Giamatti, brilliant in almost anything he does, plays a grumpy, alcoholic, sour professor who does not suffer fools and doesn't cut his privileged students any slack. Dominic Sessa is troubled teen with a dysfunctional family and mental issues. D'Avine Joy Randolf is a grieving mother stuck in a job wanting to make ends meet for her family, by her choice.This movie has great character development, a wholesome story with flawed yet lovable characters you can root for and terrific, funny dialogue. Simple, yet perfect. 9 out of 10."
"The Holdovers","frankde-jong","27 December 2023",910,"I had a lot of associations when I started watching ""The holdovers"".Kids stuck in a school during the Christmas vacation, is that not a little bit like ""The breakfast club"" (1985, John Hughes)? No, because most of the kids go away early in the film and we are left with just one pupil (Angus Tully played by Dominic Sessa) and a teacher (Paul Hunham played by Paul Giamatti).Paul Hunham teaches ancient languages and culture. Does that sounds like the Donna Tartt novel ""The secret history"" (1992)? No, in that novel the pupils are inspired by their teacher. In ""The holdovers"" the teacher is hated.One association that I did not have at all prior to watching the movie may be the most accurate: ""Scent of a woman"" (1992, Martin Brest). Also in this film a high school pupil on an expensive boarding school and a grumpy old man are condemned to each other.Best of all however we can see ""The holdovers"" as the comeback of Alexander Payne after his failed film ""Downsizing"" (2017). The film is situated in 1970 and has a very 70's look and feel, down to the aspect ratio then used. The film also contains very beautiful images of Norteast American landscapes.First of all however the film is about its three main characters. Apart from the two already introduced we have the chief cook of the boarding school Mary Lamb (Da'Vine Joy Randolph). These three people form a sort of substitute family that has to spend the Christmas season together. Each of them has his/her problems but during the film they grow closer to each other, or at least learn to understand each other better.Being a Christmas movie you expect a happy ending and somewhere in the middle of the film this happy ending seems to consist of all the members of the proxy family being on their way towards an unexpected romance. The greatness of the film is that these romances do not materialize fully. The message of the film seems to be that gaining better understanding is a happy enough ending.By the way the film does not shy away from some social criticism. The character of Paul Hunham is meant to be grumpy at first, but to me he was instantly sympathetic when he made the headmaster of the boarding school very clear that in his class wealthy parents could not buy good grades for their sons. Later he says to his pupils (at that stage of the film there are still a couple of them) that they ought to be aware of their privileged status. ""You go to Harvard, poorer boys go to Vietnam"". The Vietnam war plays an important role in the background anyway. The son of the chief cook has died in Vietnam and while visiting a bar in the village nearby the boarding school there is a local boy that lost one of his hands in Vietnam.All in all ""The holdovers"" is a very convincing comeback of Alexander Payne. He made an instant Christmas classic!"
"The Holdovers","210west","14 January 2024",410,"Alexander Payne's 1999 comedy ""Election,"" set in a Midwestern high school, was brilliant, sometimes painful, sometimes hilarious. Best of all (I say this as a onetime high school teacher), it felt refreshingly authentic.""The Holdovers"" is quite the opposite: contrived, predictable, and intended to teach -- you guessed it -- a little lesson in compassion. An hour into it, I realized that it hadn't yet contained a single moment that seemed genuine, much less surprising. Every line of dialogue sounds phony. Characters speak in little announcements, spelling things out for us. Some of the characters -- a couple of menacing townies, for example -- are mere cartoons.Giamatti's protagonist is a wholly artificial creation, designed as if in a screenwriting course to follow the approved character arc -- initially stuffy and unsympathetic to the point of caricature, ultimately vulnerable. Ironically, an early scene between him and the school's headmaster violates what's sometimes regarded as a screenwriting rule: Do NOT, even in the interest of exposition, have people telling each other what they already know. (The by-the-numbers triteness of that conversation -- meant to show us that the instructor is uncompromising and pedantic but possesses old-fashioned integrity, blah blah blah -- put me off from the start.) The scenes between Giamatti and the school's cook -- in which, with the audience in mind, the two provide personal backstories and reveal their inner selves -- are painfully heavy-handed and at times so gooey that I felt sorry for the actress: ""You can't even dream a whole dream, can you?"" she is made to say at one point. ""What are you afraid of?""Yes, I know, everybody seems to love the movie. I could barely stomach it. But do check out ""Election."""
"The Holdovers","bdesdes","30 October 2023",810,"Very enjoyable film with outstanding performances and a wonderful warm vibe accompanied by the Christmas season. It's funny at times, sad at times, and feel-good. It's a story that almost all can relate to and will really touch your heart. It deals with so many themes, but mainly grief, the past, family, and what makes a person who they are. It's also very original and has a great script, cinematography, and soundtrack. I would highly advise to see it in the theaters as well as you really get the 70's vibe and deep moment on the big screen. There aren't many negatives to this film and I would recommend it to most people."
"The Holdovers","aharmas","29 October 2023",1010,"Here is a film that feels and looks like something out of the early seventies. The Holdovers is a strong and warm-hearted piece that gives actors roles with powerful lines, without any reliance on flashy editing and being overwhelmed by special effects.The story is simple three people get stuck for the Christmas holidays in a boarding school. It's cold, lonely, and boring for the parties involved. The adults drink to cope with whatever pressures they live with. The young man resorts to bad behavior and altercations with the teacher in charge.Through the vacation period these people will get to interact and get to know each other, something that will prove to a challenge to say the least. As the story evolves, we get to understand what has made the people who they are. We get to feel their pain and frustration through the very insightful writing of the director.It's a strong film with superb acting by the main leads. They have great chemistry together.Most outstanding is Paul Giamatti who plays the tormented and defensive man with relish and speaks volumes with his eyes.Hope the academy honors his performance as the best the year because no one else so far is coming close."
"The Holdovers","darkreignn","29 October 2023",910,"Let's just get this out of the way now - when it comes to writing this review, I'm probably a little bit biased (and a little bit drunk, currently, but that's besides the point). You see, I have an affinity for indie coming of age movies, and ""The Holdovers"" is basically an indie coming of age film, so it may - or may not - come as a surprise to you that I absolutely adored this picture. So, with that little preface out of the way, it's time for me to gush over this movie.Starring none other than Paul Giamatti as Paul Hunham, Giamatti plays a professor at an all boys boarding school where, over Christmas break, he has the misfortune of looking over a group of boys, one of whom is named Angus, played by Dominic Sessa. After a rocky start, where Paul clearly doesn't get along with any of the boys, making his disdain clear and evident, he eventually finds himself alone with Angus - as well as with the school's cook, Mary Lamb, played by Da'Vine Joy Randolph - in an unexpected chain of events. What occurs after is a slice-of-life style piece of cinema that allows broken people to find comfort in each other's company.""The Holdovers"" is, without a doubt, one of my favorite movies of 2023, as well as probably one of the best movies of the year, as well. This Christmas-themed gem doesn't hold back on the drama, delivering a thoughtful blend of comedy, coming-of-age storytelling, and a touch of romance - all wrapped around a very raw, human plot-line that virtually everyone can relate to. I'm no spring chicken myself, but I found myself deeply connected to both main characters - one who is older and basically dejected with life as he knows it, and one who is younger but who feels lost, aimless, and disconnected from both family and friends. And admittedly, not everyone will have a direct parallel to these experiences, but even if you don't, you're in for a story that's bound to tug at your heartstrings... and make you laugh out loud in the process.This is a high-quality movie - from the impeccable acting to the beautiful on-location cinematography to the relatable, thought-provoking plot, every element is executed with pinpoint precision and finesse; it's a testament to the art of storytelling on the silver screen. Director Alexander Payne knows how to create an artful film, and ""The Holdovers"" is no exception. It's at once indie and art-house while simultaneously being mainstream and easily accessible; in short, it's a film for everyone that actually feels like a genuine crowdpleaser instead of a pandering mess.I'm having a difficult time describing what I liked about this movie, and the reason is because I liked almost everything about this movie. So why the 9 out of 10 rating instead of the perfect 10? Literally the only thing that's holding me back is because I would've liked a touch more romance; yes, there was romance here, but a bit more would've pushed me over the edge into 10 out of 10 territory. Besides that, this is basically a perfect film, one that I loved, and one that has become one of my favorite movies of the year, if not of all time. I am genuinely looking forward to rewatching this, and I can't wait until it becomes closer to Christmas so I can view this on my own TV, cuddled under blankets, with a glass of whiskey, and bask in the absolute heartwarming experience that is ""The Holdovers."" My recommendation: Do yourself a favor and watch this as soon as you can - you won't regret it."
"The Holdovers","evanston_dad","20 November 2023",1010,"Mid-way through ""The Holdovers,"" I started openly weeping in the movie theater, and I pretty much kept it up on and off for the rest of the movie. Sometimes, there wasn't even anything obviously sad or moving happening in the scene, and I still couldn't stop. I think it's because this movie is so kind, and kindness is a rare commodity these days. It's sad to think that a movie about characters learning to have compassion for each other and for the hardships they've been through should feel like such a rare beast, but here we are.This is Alexander Payne firing on all cylinders as a director, and though he didn't write this movie, it feels like he could have. It's an obvious throwback to the kinds of movies Hal Ashby made throughout the 1970s and is touching in exactly the same way ""Harold and Maude"" was. It's also a master class in acting from the three principal characters played by Paul Giamatti, Dominic Sessa, and Da 'Vine Joy Randolph, and I hope all three of them, and the movie overall, is remembered come Oscar time.This will easily make my top ten list for the year.Grade: A+"
"The Holdovers","Xstal","28 November 2023",810,"Now here's a film with a life affirming theme, that should encourage most viewers to think of their dreams, and cascade away all their cloaks, inhibitions, and open fresh doors to their heart's intuitions; as a teacher whose life is as stale as dead fish, whose life is the opposite of happy and bliss, meets a boy who's ignored by all those he holds dear, and a friendship is formed that is warm and sincere; it's a subtle reflection of how we get trapped, by tradition and habits and past circumstance, where surroundings like prisons can temper our thinking, to distil all our spirit, to bottles for drinking; so embrace all the chances when they come along, break out of that mould and sing your own song, open your eyes to the paths unexplored, take a stand and stand tall, and stop being ignored."
"The Holdovers","steiner-sam","10 November 2023",910,"It's a comedy-drama set from December 16, 1970, to the first week of January 1971 in an exclusive boy's boarding school in New England and Boston, Massachusetts. It follows the experiences of the ""holdovers,"" that is, the students who cannot go home over the Christmas holidays and the two Barton staff left to supervise them during the holidays.There are five holdovers: Teddy Kountze (Brady Hepner), Jason Smith (Michael Provost), and Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa) are upper-class wealthy WASP students. Alex Ollerman (Ian Dolley) is a younger Mormon student whose parents are on a mission in South America. Ye-Joon Park (Jim Kaplan) is from South Korea.Left to supervise is Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti), an unmarried ancient history teacher who was once a student at Barton and has taught there all his career. He's a demanding curmudgeon who almost everyone dislikes. African American Mary Lamb (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), the head cook, is also present; her son, a Barton grad, has just been killed in Vietnam.The film follows the shared experiences of the holdovers, though four students leave after a week when a wealthy father takes them for a ski holiday. Paul cannot contact Angus's parents, so he must stay with Paul and Mary at Barton. We also meet the school's headmaster, Hardy Woodrup (Andrew Garman), his administrative assistant, Lydia Crane (Carrie Preston), and janitor Danny (Naheem Garcia).""The Holdovers"" is a delightful comedy leavened with wisdom as we learn the dark secrets that have shaped Paul Hunham and Angus Tully. Giamatti, Sessa, and Randolph are all excellent. The script unfolds the twists and turns superbly. ""The Holdovers"" is a great Christmas movie."
"The Holdovers","JohnDeSando","16 November 2023",NA,"""I find the world a bitter and complicated place. And it seems to feel the same way about me."" Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti)Teaching privileged boys at an elite new England prep school called Barton (think for example, Philips Exeter), might be the pinnacle of an academic's career. But not Paul Hunham in The Holdovers, an elite movie itself of the year.Paul should be teaching classics at an ivy school, not teaching entitled ""vermin,"" among the many sobriquets he tosses around about the fortunate young men to experience his brand of grumpy intellectualism and misanthropy. He prepares them for a world that won't always be coddling and protecting them as their family wealth so naturally does in their early years.Director Alexander Payne worked with Giamatti in Sideways, so he is prepared to have another winning cynical character who is endearing while distanced by negative temperament from normally positive fellow humans (Paul's last name, Hunham, suggests a distant connection with the better angels of humanity).As Paul accepts the assignment to supervise holdovers (exiled to Christmas vacation in the absence of parents or guardians), the number whittles down to just Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa, reminiscent of young, Timothy Chalamet and Adam Driver), who shares Paul's dark attitudes and, with the sharp writing of David Hemingson, some witty dialogue- e.g., about Paul he says, ""I thought all of the Nazis had left for Argentina.""Although, as in likeminded dramas such as Dead Poet's Society or Goodbye, Mr. Chips, the principals are destined to be transformed into more humane characters, Holdovers continues, even in its denouement, to accentuate the unsunny side of life for Paul and Tully, whose fortunes are still compromised by cold-hearted parents and administrators. The chilly world, however, is warmed on these lovely, snowbound days, by women, viz., the cook, Mary (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) and administrator Lydia (Carrie Preston).Mary good-naturedly deals with the death of her son, Curtis, a Barton grad who had to join the military because he did not have the resources as other Barton grads of the late '60s did to avoid the draft.Lydia, an attractive middle-aged staff member, holds the promise of a love interest for Paul, only to show how difficult it is for social exiles to enter the romantic mainstream.The Holdovers is a small gem of a move that will immediately remind buffs about Hal Ashby comedies of the same era like Harold & Maude, where character development is paramount and detachment from the mainstream is required to look at humanity clearly with its foibles and endearments.The Holdovers is a movie everyone can enjoy with endearing characters who share with us our moments about loneliness peppered with the possibilities of love and happiness.""Do you think I want to be babysitting you? No. I was praying your mother would pick up the phone, or your father would arrive in a helicopter or a flying saucer...."" Paul Hunham."
"The Holdovers","dtswpod","6 November 2023",810,"Do you miss how they used to make films in the 1970s? Plenty of filmmakers do, except they take that nostalgia and just do watered down versions of better movies. As an example see Taxi Driver and King of Comedy then watch Joker and you'll get what I mean.Thankfully, Alexander Payne has managed to take his sentimentality and make an original film out of it. Or if The Holdovers is a pale imitation of a superior picture then the filmmaker has managed to trick me because I don't feel as if I've seen this movie before but done better.Now to be clear, there aren't things you've never seen before in the movie. I mean, you know the characters are going to bond at some point. And people will grow to care about each other. That's a given. How we get there, however, is what makes the film seem fresh and entertaining and ever bit as good as any flick made back in the day.I hope more people see it."
"The Holdovers","tdwillis-26273","7 December 2023",810,"Finally......a GOOD movie. The story/script, although not a breakthrough idea, was heartfelt,full and real.The settings were also real and gorgeous (not really a cgi fan)
Camera, cinematography, lighting,sound,score....every level made my eyes and ears satisfyingly full.Acting was oscarworthy across the board.Directing was brilliant.Only negative I can come up with is that the pace was a bit slow, but so much of the movie is so focused and so superbly and beautifully made I just sat back and enjoyed it.A very thoughtful substantial and beautiful movie. A rare gem in today's superficial gimmicky movie making world."
"The Holdovers","ferguson-6","8 November 2023",810,"Greetings again from the darkness. We've all had that teacher. You know, the one with an evil streak who just seemed to thrive on making students miserable. Throw in a staff and administrators who feel the same way, and the casting choice for the teacher becomes obvious. Enter the always great and perfectly curmudgeonly Paul Giamatti. This is the first time Giamatti has worked with two-time Oscar winner Alexander Payne since their brilliant SIDEWAYS (2004), and it's clear these two share a wavelength for comedy and drama, even in throwback form.Paul Hunham (Giamatti) is a long-time professor at Barton Academy, an all-boys private prep school located in the snowy northeast. It's December 1970, and an early scene exemplifies how he relishes the failing grades he bestows upon desperate students so afraid to disappoint their rich parents. In the final class before the holiday break, the student-teacher banter doesn't go so well for the boys, and they head to break with an extra workload. Hunham is easily manipulated into babysitting the titular holdovers - students stuck at school over the break, while most others spend time with family, often on exotic trips.Initially there are five students, but after a certain development, what remains is Hunham, smart but troubled Angus Tully (first timer Dominic Sessa) and the school's head cook, Mary Lamb (a divine Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019). Hunham is perpetually annoyed and has a weakness for booze. Angus is frustrated that his mother left him at school so she could travel with her new husband, and Mary is grieving over her son who was killed in Vietnam. Watching these three struggle to bond is a case study in psychology, yet of course we know they will ultimately form a family of misfits, depending on each other to offset the loneliness.The genius tagline for the film is ""Discomfort and Joy"", and initially the first overshadows the latter. Isolated from the world in their own way, the three characters begin to influence each other, showing broken/wounded people need and deserve love and friendship as much as anyone else. ""Entre nous"" (just between us) becomes a kind of calling card for this trio, and a Christmas party thrown by an eternally optimistic staffer (Carrie Preston) is a turning point.Giamatti is master of this material and only goes over the top a time or two. It's painful and humorous each time he is so anxious to infuse his breadth of ancient civilization facts into even the most mundane conversations. Newcomer Sessa possesses star potential and nails a complex first role. Da'Vine Joy Randolph's Mary is the heart of the film, doling out advice to Hunham and comfort to Angus. Depression is a vein running through these characters and it's acknowledged, though not the focus.This is Alexander Payne's first film since the disappointing DOWNSIZING (2017), but his brilliance has been proven in ABOUT SCHMIDT (2002), SIDEWAYS (2004), THE DESCENDANTS (2011), and NEBRASKA (2013). This time he's working from a screenplay by successful TV writer, David Hemingson, and though there is never much suspense about where the story or characters are headed, we enjoy the ride immensely. Cinematography from Eigil Byrld (IN BRUGES, 2008), perfectly complements the emotions (shot on digital, graininess added in post), and the soundtrack is period-specific, including the great Cat Stevens. Pay attention to the retro opening credits and logos, and enjoy a smart and funny film (an Alexander Payne trademark).Opening in theaters November 10, 2023."
"The Holdovers","akcenat","1 January 2024",810,"""The Holdovers"" is a captivating blend of comedy and drama that beautifully explores the complexities of human relationships.Story is about a grumpy instructor (Paul Giamatti) at a New England prep school who forms an unexpected bond with a troubled student during the Christmas break. Because it is set in the 1970s, the film in a way is a nostalgic journey back in time, but with a narrative that is both engaging and thought-provoking.The performances are exceptional, with Giamatti delivering a compelling portrayal of a man grappling with his own loneliness and the challenges of mentorship. The film's narrative is richly layered, exploring themes of loneliness, friendship, and personal growth. It's a story that resonates, offering a poignant reflection on the human condition. The film's setting in the 1970s adds a layer of nostalgia, further enhancing the emotional depth of the narrative. Despite its lengthy runtime, ""The Holdovers"" mostly maintains a steady pace, balancing its dramatic elements with moments of humor and warmth. The main plus of the movie is its dialogue-driven approach that adds to its charm, creating a sense of authenticity and depth in its character interactions.Overall, this is a film that leaves a lasting impression, offering a thoughtful exploration of human relationships set against the backdrop of a bygone era. With its exceptional performances and engaging narrative, I'm giving it an 8 out of 10 rating. It's a must-watch for those seeking a film that combines drama, comedy, and a touch of nostalgia."
"The Holdovers","Quinoa1984","30 October 2023",1010,"The Holdovers is, for all of the character dynamics and dysfunction and depression and other things we find out about the leads, mostly with Mr. Hunham and Angus and how their characters over these couple of weeks turn away from the ""Barton"" way of not telling lies (because, well, sometimes context and the moment matter for telling a lie that won't really hurt, maybe), a strangely comforting film to watch. Not for all of that exactly, though what we understand slowly but surely is this is all material for comedy and tragedy in equal measure, but because of the feeling that we get with a filmmaker who is so primed and confident with material that you don't feel like it can go wrong.What is more impressive is that, as enjoyable as the first half is, it is in the ""I like this"" mode as we are introduced to this world and Hunham and Angus and Mary, but it doesn't feel so special. But I should have known Payne and writer David Hemingson were laying down the necessary groundwork for what comes the moment a) the majority of the other supporting characters leave for reasons I don't have to mention here, and b) then the characters go outside the Barton campus grounds on a holiday party and then a ""field trip"" to Boston, you get the sense moment by moment and interaction by interaction it is so sharp and cutting and wise, and one scene in particular makes the jump into ""oh, OK, this is taking off into another level of personal pain and about familial expectations and what will come with in a life measuring up to others - and why that is wrong - and... yeah, it's great"" territory.In other words, it's the kind of film I want to watch again right away simply because now that I know a little more about the characters, I'll want to experience all of the extra textures (its 1970 down to the wood paneling and the car seats), and dig a little more into those absolutely wonderful natural restrained and complete performances - we take Giamatti for granted sometimes and this is a character he should be proud of to craft, lazy-ass eyes and all; Sessa's first role and he is an immediate star; I can't be more sure of anything for the next Oscar's that, if Randolph is nominated, she will win, if nothing else for everything she does at the Christmas party scenes, and a moment looking over some objects in a room later on is so moving - and my comfort is in seeing Payne clearly loving directing this intimate character study where he can show what a comedically observant, quick witted, and heartbreaking story this all is.It's one of the best Christmas movies in several years, embodying many themes and ideals that fit like a 70s wool sweater, and I'm sure the first thing Payne must have thought after reading the script was ""whoa. This is gonna be the best Hal Ashby or Bob Rafelson movie never made... is 'The Last Holdover' too on the nose?"" Even Hunham would give this... a B+ probably (did he ever give As? Shrug)."
"The Holdovers","jjgonzalez-06426","31 October 2023",910,"Quite possibly one of the best Christmas films ever? I first saw Payne & Giamatti's previous film together, ""Sideways"" during my screenwriting training class, and it is one that I would think of for a while. Their new film, ""The Holdovers"", is hilarious, beautifully shot and acted, heartwarming, and has a great sense of grief and joy meshed together. Definitely leaning towards Randolph for Best Supporting Actress; her performance BLEW me away.Overall, I love these films. Light-hearted & comedic while also have a sense of darkness and a lot of heavy emotion to it. Definitely is one of the most heartfelt films of the year."
"The Holdovers","paul-allaer","20 November 2023",810,"As ""The Holdovers"" (2023 release; 133 min.) opens, it's 1970 and we are at the Barton HS boarding school in New England as the Fall semester wraps up. Paul Hunham, a teacher of classical studies and a curmudgeon, gets summoned by the head of school, and is told he will take charge of the 4 or 5 ""holdovers"", students who for one reason or another, cannot go home and need to stay at the boarding school for the entire Christmas break... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest from director Alexander Payne (""Sideways"", ""The Descendants""). Here he brings to the big screen what life is like in Fall of 1970 among a group of privileged HS students along with their testy classics teacher and a Black woman who runs the kitchen. On the surface of it all, this looks to be a terrible combination, but as the movie plays out, more and more is revealed. The movie is plot-heavy and I shan't say another word on that. Paul Giamatti, a regular of Payne's prior movie work, brings what I feel is one of his strongest movie roles ever. Da'Vine Joy Randolph is outstanding as the Black kitchen supervisor with a heavy heart. Dominic Sessa is frankly too old (33 in real life) to play the rebellious HS student Angus (17 in the movie), I mean, it's really really obvious. That said, Payne just hits all the right notes in this film, and this resonated with me on so many levels. Despite the serious undertones, there are quite a few funny moments in the movie as well.""The Holdovers"" premiered a few months ago at the Telluride film festival to immediate and widespread critical acclaim. There is good reason why this is currently rated 87% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. The movie opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati the weekend before last. The early Sunday evening screening where I saw this at was attended so-so (about 12-15 people). If you are in the mood for a top-notch comedy drama, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion."
"The Holdovers","imseeg","14 December 2023",610,"I am big fan of director Alexander Payne (The Descendants, Sideways) and of actor Paul Giamatti in particular. Both have teamed up before with marvellous results, but this movie has got 1 problem that made me only rate it with 6 stars though:The bad:the middle part of this story stretches out too long, with several quite tedious scenes, which could have easily been cut out of it without hurting the storyline. I started watching at my watch half way through several times because of this lack of spark and punch. Such a pity!Fortunately this movie picked up momentum again towards the warmhearted Christmas spirited final, but I still will only award this movie with 6 stars (instead of 7) because I got bored at many moments during the somewhat tedious and long middle part.The story: It's about a young student and his teacher, who both are lonely souls and although they cant stand each other at first, eventually slowly do bond with each other during a Christmas holiday. Acting by Paul Giamatti is masterful (as always), BUT some of the other actors fail to impress me.Not the best of director Alexander Payne's work, but definitely still worth a watch, because it left me in my seat with a smile on my face and a feel good Christmas spirit of caring for one another!"

If this film doesn't make you feel sone kind of emotion, you are absolutely heartless. You love these characters. You feel for them on every single level. The film itself feels like a film from the 70s. The twists and turns the film takes are wonderful and heartwarming/heartbreaking. Paul Giamatti is excellent as always. This is Dominic Sessa's first film and he does an outstanding job. No crazy special effects or bloated explosions. Just great filmmaking. It's streaming on Peacock. An absolute holiday must. Take the time to watch it. You'll love it."
"The Holdovers","arfdawg-1","26 December 2023",510,"Lots of great reviews here. Many people who have seen Sideways seem to be excited that Giamatti has re-teamed with Payne the director.Of course, the film is in no way related to the other movie, except that both were involved and that Sideways has quite a cult following.Unfortunately this is not my type of movie. I'm not saying it's bad. And I'm not saying anything bad about the people who seem to love it. It's just not for me.It's a character driven movie, which is fine, except I didnt bond with any of the characters. And I found the choice of musical tunes throughout to be annoying at best.So if you like drawn out period piece character driven flicks, you may like this one. I didn't love it, but I could see how some might, hence the ""5"" rating."
"The Holdovers","kevin_robbins","31 December 2023",910,"My wife and I watched The Holdovers (2023) on Peacock last night. The storyline unfolds at a boarding school in Massachusetts during holiday vacation, focusing on the kids with nowhere to go for the holidays and the staff assigned to care for them, who happen to be facing a similar issue. Together, they work to uncover inner demons and find a way to release them, allowing everyone to truly enjoy the holiday season.Directed by Alexander Payne (Sideways), the film stars Paul Giamatti (American Splendor), Da'Vine Joy Randolph (Dolemite is my Name), Dominic Sessa, and Carrie Preston (Claws).This is an exceptionally unique holiday film, offering intriguing settings, characters, and circumstances. All facets are fascinating and worthwhile, with outstanding writing that establishes the storyline and various subplots effectively. The dialogue is absolutely superb, featuring a well-balanced blend of raw emotion, character development, and comedy. The eyebrow-raising conclusion is perfect for the characters' concluding direction.In conclusion, The Holdovers is a unique and captivating character piece that's an absolute must-see. I would score this a 9/10 and strongly recommend it."
"The Holdovers","euroGary","19 October 2023",1010,"One does not expect a Christmas film to be challenging, and this one certainly isn't. But it is a lot of fun.A boys' boarding school empties of almost all staff and pupils for the 1970/1 Festive Season. Left behind are Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti), the unpopular history teacher who has to keep an eye on the school; Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa), a teenaged pupil whose mother does not want him on her honeymoon; and Mary Lamb (the impressively-named Da'Vine Joy Randolph), the school cook who is facing her first Christmas alone since her son died on military service. As these three lonely souls come together, there are tantrums, emotional revelations, the revealing of long-hidden secrets, a noble sacrifice... the usual stuff.Also the usual stuff are the characters: Paul is cynical and frustrated; Angus is ironic and insecure; and as Mary is overweight and black, she of course has to be sassy.But while in some films such predictability would be annoying, it works here. Within the limits of their somewhat two-dimensional personalities, the characters are well-written - even Angus' tantrums do not seem unreasonable. Plus, there are some great gags (""You hit him? You mean you punched him out?"" ""No, I hit him with a car..."") And I will not be the only viewer who finishes the film with a lump in his throat.Great fun. I can easily see myself buying the DVD and watching this for many Christmases to come..."
"The Holdovers","cherold","31 December 2023",810,"This movie is about a handful of entitled boys who regretfully must stay behind during the Christmas break at their private school and the teacher and cook there to oversee them.It's a funny and affecting movie with excellent performances from the leads, especially Paul giamatti as the prickly teacher.It's a Christmas movie of sorts, since it does take place at Christmas, but it's really more of an anytime of the year film in which you get to see people have adventures and fight and grow and that sort of thing.It's very well filmed, it's very entertaining, and I would recommend you watch it."
"The Holdovers","bastille-852-731547","29 October 2023",610,"Set in December 1970, ""The Holdovers"" follows a small group of students who have to stay on campus over the Christmas break at Barton Academy (a prestigious boarding school in Massachusetts,) alongside a curmudgeonly ancient history teacher (Paul Giamatti.) That sounds like a potentially amusing premise for a breezy comedy-drama, especially when Alexander Payne is directing. Having greatly enjoyed and admired several of Payne's previous films such as ""Sideways,"" ""The Descendants,"" and ""Nebraska,"" I was looking forward to this film. Overall, I found it to be simply fine and not up to par with the level of quality of most of Payne's films. There's nothing too wrong with it by any stretch of the imagination, but it's often generic and forgettable compared to Payne's other films.An indie dramedy like this film would generally be expected to be defined by being character- and writing-driven. Unfortunately, neither the characters nor the writing here are especially unique enough to structure a compelling plot around. Paul (Giamatti's character) is very generic, as is the rebellious student Angus, whose relationship with Paul is a pivotal part of the film. On a better note, Da'Vine Joy Randolph gives a strong and impactful performance as Mary, a cafeteria worker dealing with bereavement; her character is interestingly more dynamic and multi-dimensional than either Paul or Angus. The writing and humor is less unique, funny, or engaging than many of Payne's films, as the attempts at plot devices, character development, and humor often boil down to insult comedy between Paul and Angus--which, ultimately, wears out its welcome a bit, and actually causes a bit of collateral damage in making the film's tone and story feel less sincere. Regardless of the sincerity of the story, another thing that is clear here is that there needed to be a stronger and less predictable core to the plot in order for the film to remain engaging for its 133-minute runtime.The film's retro, 1970s-aesthetic is commendable and helps contribute to the atmosphere of the film, and there still are some sporadic sweet moments of Paul and Mary hanging out around the television and a few decent jokes here and there. So ""The Holdovers"" is a fine enough film, but it won't be a new holiday classic for me. 6/10."
"The Holdovers","RahulM007","31 October 2023",1010,"""Penis cancer in human form.""Alexander Payne's ""The Holdovers"" is a laugh-out-loud comedy strengthened by Paul Giamatti and Dominic Sessa's magnetic performances and their incredible chemistry together. I am in awe by the film's brilliant and inventive screenplay, 70s-style cinematography, slick editing, and great production design. I could watch Paul and Angus bicker for another two hours. Throughout the film, the humour gets more interwoven leading to a crescendo of hilarity. ""The Holdovers"" offers the perfect blend of humor and pathos.*That waitress was so rude for refusing to accept their order of cherries jubilee. She is a fascist and a ""penis cancer in human form"".*The film reminded me of Peter Weir's ""Dead Poets Society"", Milos Forman's ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", and John Hughes' ""The Breakfast Club"" (kind of).Final verdict: 10/10."
"The Holdovers","Avwillfan89","29 November 2023",910,"Finally, Alexander Payne has made a worthy follow up to his (in my opinion at least) masterpiece Sideways.I really related so much to all three of the main characters, who all come from different backgrounds. Paul Giamatti, brilliant in almost anything he does, plays a grumpy, alcoholic, sour professor who does not suffer fools and doesn't cut his privileged students any slack. Dominic Sessa is troubled teen with a dysfunctional family and mental issues. D'Avine Joy Randolf is a grieving mother stuck in a job wanting to make ends meet for her family, by her choice.This movie has great character development, a wholesome story with flawed yet lovable characters you can root for and terrific, funny dialogue. Simple, yet perfect. 9 out of 10."
"The Holdovers","frankde-jong","27 December 2023",910,"I had a lot of associations when I started watching ""The holdovers"".Kids stuck in a school during the Christmas vacation, is that not a little bit like ""The breakfast club"" (1985, John Hughes)? No, because most of the kids go away early in the film and we are left with just one pupil (Angus Tully played by Dominic Sessa) and a teacher (Paul Hunham played by Paul Giamatti).Paul Hunham teaches ancient languages and culture. Does that sounds like the Donna Tartt novel ""The secret history"" (1992)? No, in that novel the pupils are inspired by their teacher. In ""The holdovers"" the teacher is hated.One association that I did not have at all prior to watching the movie may be the most accurate: ""Scent of a woman"" (1992, Martin Brest). Also in this film a high school pupil on an expensive boarding school and a grumpy old man are condemned to each other.Best of all however we can see ""The holdovers"" as the comeback of Alexander Payne after his failed film ""Downsizing"" (2017). The film is situated in 1970 and has a very 70's look and feel, down to the aspect ratio then used. The film also contains very beautiful images of Norteast American landscapes.First of all however the film is about its three main characters. Apart from the two already introduced we have the chief cook of the boarding school Mary Lamb (Da'Vine Joy Randolph). These three people form a sort of substitute family that has to spend the Christmas season together. Each of them has his/her problems but during the film they grow closer to each other, or at least learn to understand each other better.Being a Christmas movie you expect a happy ending and somewhere in the middle of the film this happy ending seems to consist of all the members of the proxy family being on their way towards an unexpected romance. The greatness of the film is that these romances do not materialize fully. The message of the film seems to be that gaining better understanding is a happy enough ending.By the way the film does not shy away from some social criticism. The character of Paul Hunham is meant to be grumpy at first, but to me he was instantly sympathetic when he made the headmaster of the boarding school very clear that in his class wealthy parents could not buy good grades for their sons. Later he says to his pupils (at that stage of the film there are still a couple of them) that they ought to be aware of their privileged status. ""You go to Harvard, poorer boys go to Vietnam"". The Vietnam war plays an important role in the background anyway. The son of the chief cook has died in Vietnam and while visiting a bar in the village nearby the boarding school there is a local boy that lost one of his hands in Vietnam.All in all ""The holdovers"" is a very convincing comeback of Alexander Payne. He made an instant Christmas classic!"
"The Holdovers","210west","14 January 2024",410,"Alexander Payne's 1999 comedy ""Election,"" set in a Midwestern high school, was brilliant, sometimes painful, sometimes hilarious. Best of all (I say this as a onetime high school teacher), it felt refreshingly authentic.""The Holdovers"" is quite the opposite: contrived, predictable, and intended to teach -- you guessed it -- a little lesson in compassion. An hour into it, I realized that it hadn't yet contained a single moment that seemed genuine, much less surprising. Every line of dialogue sounds phony. Characters speak in little announcements, spelling things out for us. Some of the characters -- a couple of menacing townies, for example -- are mere cartoons.Giamatti's protagonist is a wholly artificial creation, designed as if in a screenwriting course to follow the approved character arc -- initially stuffy and unsympathetic to the point of caricature, ultimately vulnerable. Ironically, an early scene between him and the school's headmaster violates what's sometimes regarded as a screenwriting rule: Do NOT, even in the interest of exposition, have people telling each other what they already know. (The by-the-numbers triteness of that conversation -- meant to show us that the instructor is uncompromising and pedantic but possesses old-fashioned integrity, blah blah blah -- put me off from the start.) The scenes between Giamatti and the school's cook -- in which, with the audience in mind, the two provide personal backstories and reveal their inner selves -- are painfully heavy-handed and at times so gooey that I felt sorry for the actress: ""You can't even dream a whole dream, can you?"" she is made to say at one point. ""What are you afraid of?""Yes, I know, everybody seems to love the movie. I could barely stomach it. But do check out ""Election."""
"The Holdovers","bdesdes","30 October 2023",810,"Very enjoyable film with outstanding performances and a wonderful warm vibe accompanied by the Christmas season. It's funny at times, sad at times, and feel-good. It's a story that almost all can relate to and will really touch your heart. It deals with so many themes, but mainly grief, the past, family, and what makes a person who they are. It's also very original and has a great script, cinematography, and soundtrack. I would highly advise to see it in the theaters as well as you really get the 70's vibe and deep moment on the big screen. There aren't many negatives to this film and I would recommend it to most people."
"The Holdovers","aharmas","29 October 2023",1010,"Here is a film that feels and looks like something out of the early seventies. The Holdovers is a strong and warm-hearted piece that gives actors roles with powerful lines, without any reliance on flashy editing and being overwhelmed by special effects.The story is simple three people get stuck for the Christmas holidays in a boarding school. It's cold, lonely, and boring for the parties involved. The adults drink to cope with whatever pressures they live with. The young man resorts to bad behavior and altercations with the teacher in charge.Through the vacation period these people will get to interact and get to know each other, something that will prove to a challenge to say the least. As the story evolves, we get to understand what has made the people who they are. We get to feel their pain and frustration through the very insightful writing of the director.It's a strong film with superb acting by the main leads. They have great chemistry together.Most outstanding is Paul Giamatti who plays the tormented and defensive man with relish and speaks volumes with his eyes.Hope the academy honors his performance as the best the year because no one else so far is coming close."
"The Holdovers","darkreignn","29 October 2023",910,"Let's just get this out of the way now - when it comes to writing this review, I'm probably a little bit biased (and a little bit drunk, currently, but that's besides the point). You see, I have an affinity for indie coming of age movies, and ""The Holdovers"" is basically an indie coming of age film, so it may - or may not - come as a surprise to you that I absolutely adored this picture. So, with that little preface out of the way, it's time for me to gush over this movie.Starring none other than Paul Giamatti as Paul Hunham, Giamatti plays a professor at an all boys boarding school where, over Christmas break, he has the misfortune of looking over a group of boys, one of whom is named Angus, played by Dominic Sessa. After a rocky start, where Paul clearly doesn't get along with any of the boys, making his disdain clear and evident, he eventually finds himself alone with Angus - as well as with the school's cook, Mary Lamb, played by Da'Vine Joy Randolph - in an unexpected chain of events. What occurs after is a slice-of-life style piece of cinema that allows broken people to find comfort in each other's company.""The Holdovers"" is, without a doubt, one of my favorite movies of 2023, as well as probably one of the best movies of the year, as well. This Christmas-themed gem doesn't hold back on the drama, delivering a thoughtful blend of comedy, coming-of-age storytelling, and a touch of romance - all wrapped around a very raw, human plot-line that virtually everyone can relate to. I'm no spring chicken myself, but I found myself deeply connected to both main characters - one who is older and basically dejected with life as he knows it, and one who is younger but who feels lost, aimless, and disconnected from both family and friends. And admittedly, not everyone will have a direct parallel to these experiences, but even if you don't, you're in for a story that's bound to tug at your heartstrings... and make you laugh out loud in the process.This is a high-quality movie - from the impeccable acting to the beautiful on-location cinematography to the relatable, thought-provoking plot, every element is executed with pinpoint precision and finesse; it's a testament to the art of storytelling on the silver screen. Director Alexander Payne knows how to create an artful film, and ""The Holdovers"" is no exception. It's at once indie and art-house while simultaneously being mainstream and easily accessible; in short, it's a film for everyone that actually feels like a genuine crowdpleaser instead of a pandering mess.I'm having a difficult time describing what I liked about this movie, and the reason is because I liked almost everything about this movie. So why the 9 out of 10 rating instead of the perfect 10? Literally the only thing that's holding me back is because I would've liked a touch more romance; yes, there was romance here, but a bit more would've pushed me over the edge into 10 out of 10 territory. Besides that, this is basically a perfect film, one that I loved, and one that has become one of my favorite movies of the year, if not of all time. I am genuinely looking forward to rewatching this, and I can't wait until it becomes closer to Christmas so I can view this on my own TV, cuddled under blankets, with a glass of whiskey, and bask in the absolute heartwarming experience that is ""The Holdovers."" My recommendation: Do yourself a favor and watch this as soon as you can - you won't regret it."
"The Holdovers","evanston_dad","20 November 2023",1010,"Mid-way through ""The Holdovers,"" I started openly weeping in the movie theater, and I pretty much kept it up on and off for the rest of the movie. Sometimes, there wasn't even anything obviously sad or moving happening in the scene, and I still couldn't stop. I think it's because this movie is so kind, and kindness is a rare commodity these days. It's sad to think that a movie about characters learning to have compassion for each other and for the hardships they've been through should feel like such a rare beast, but here we are.This is Alexander Payne firing on all cylinders as a director, and though he didn't write this movie, it feels like he could have. It's an obvious throwback to the kinds of movies Hal Ashby made throughout the 1970s and is touching in exactly the same way ""Harold and Maude"" was. It's also a master class in acting from the three principal characters played by Paul Giamatti, Dominic Sessa, and Da 'Vine Joy Randolph, and I hope all three of them, and the movie overall, is remembered come Oscar time.This will easily make my top ten list for the year.Grade: A+"
"The Holdovers","Xstal","28 November 2023",810,"Now here's a film with a life affirming theme, that should encourage most viewers to think of their dreams, and cascade away all their cloaks, inhibitions, and open fresh doors to their heart's intuitions; as a teacher whose life is as stale as dead fish, whose life is the opposite of happy and bliss, meets a boy who's ignored by all those he holds dear, and a friendship is formed that is warm and sincere; it's a subtle reflection of how we get trapped, by tradition and habits and past circumstance, where surroundings like prisons can temper our thinking, to distil all our spirit, to bottles for drinking; so embrace all the chances when they come along, break out of that mould and sing your own song, open your eyes to the paths unexplored, take a stand and stand tall, and stop being ignored."
"The Holdovers","steiner-sam","10 November 2023",910,"It's a comedy-drama set from December 16, 1970, to the first week of January 1971 in an exclusive boy's boarding school in New England and Boston, Massachusetts. It follows the experiences of the ""holdovers,"" that is, the students who cannot go home over the Christmas holidays and the two Barton staff left to supervise them during the holidays.There are five holdovers: Teddy Kountze (Brady Hepner), Jason Smith (Michael Provost), and Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa) are upper-class wealthy WASP students. Alex Ollerman (Ian Dolley) is a younger Mormon student whose parents are on a mission in South America. Ye-Joon Park (Jim Kaplan) is from South Korea.Left to supervise is Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti), an unmarried ancient history teacher who was once a student at Barton and has taught there all his career. He's a demanding curmudgeon who almost everyone dislikes. African American Mary Lamb (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), the head cook, is also present; her son, a Barton grad, has just been killed in Vietnam.The film follows the shared experiences of the holdovers, though four students leave after a week when a wealthy father takes them for a ski holiday. Paul cannot contact Angus's parents, so he must stay with Paul and Mary at Barton. We also meet the school's headmaster, Hardy Woodrup (Andrew Garman), his administrative assistant, Lydia Crane (Carrie Preston), and janitor Danny (Naheem Garcia).""The Holdovers"" is a delightful comedy leavened with wisdom as we learn the dark secrets that have shaped Paul Hunham and Angus Tully. Giamatti, Sessa, and Randolph are all excellent. The script unfolds the twists and turns superbly. ""The Holdovers"" is a great Christmas movie."
"The Holdovers","JohnDeSando","16 November 2023",NA,"""I find the world a bitter and complicated place. And it seems to feel the same way about me."" Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti)Teaching privileged boys at an elite new England prep school called Barton (think for example, Philips Exeter), might be the pinnacle of an academic's career. But not Paul Hunham in The Holdovers, an elite movie itself of the year.Paul should be teaching classics at an ivy school, not teaching entitled ""vermin,"" among the many sobriquets he tosses around about the fortunate young men to experience his brand of grumpy intellectualism and misanthropy. He prepares them for a world that won't always be coddling and protecting them as their family wealth so naturally does in their early years.Director Alexander Payne worked with Giamatti in Sideways, so he is prepared to have another winning cynical character who is endearing while distanced by negative temperament from normally positive fellow humans (Paul's last name, Hunham, suggests a distant connection with the better angels of humanity).As Paul accepts the assignment to supervise holdovers (exiled to Christmas vacation in the absence of parents or guardians), the number whittles down to just Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa, reminiscent of young, Timothy Chalamet and Adam Driver), who shares Paul's dark attitudes and, with the sharp writing of David Hemingson, some witty dialogue- e.g., about Paul he says, ""I thought all of the Nazis had left for Argentina.""Although, as in likeminded dramas such as Dead Poet's Society or Goodbye, Mr. Chips, the principals are destined to be transformed into more humane characters, Holdovers continues, even in its denouement, to accentuate the unsunny side of life for Paul and Tully, whose fortunes are still compromised by cold-hearted parents and administrators. The chilly world, however, is warmed on these lovely, snowbound days, by women, viz., the cook, Mary (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) and administrator Lydia (Carrie Preston).Mary good-naturedly deals with the death of her son, Curtis, a Barton grad who had to join the military because he did not have the resources as other Barton grads of the late '60s did to avoid the draft.Lydia, an attractive middle-aged staff member, holds the promise of a love interest for Paul, only to show how difficult it is for social exiles to enter the romantic mainstream.The Holdovers is a small gem of a move that will immediately remind buffs about Hal Ashby comedies of the same era like Harold & Maude, where character development is paramount and detachment from the mainstream is required to look at humanity clearly with its foibles and endearments.The Holdovers is a movie everyone can enjoy with endearing characters who share with us our moments about loneliness peppered with the possibilities of love and happiness.""Do you think I want to be babysitting you? No. I was praying your mother would pick up the phone, or your father would arrive in a helicopter or a flying saucer...."" Paul Hunham."
"The Holdovers","dtswpod","6 November 2023",810,"Do you miss how they used to make films in the 1970s? Plenty of filmmakers do, except they take that nostalgia and just do watered down versions of better movies. As an example see Taxi Driver and King of Comedy then watch Joker and you'll get what I mean.Thankfully, Alexander Payne has managed to take his sentimentality and make an original film out of it. Or if The Holdovers is a pale imitation of a superior picture then the filmmaker has managed to trick me because I don't feel as if I've seen this movie before but done better.Now to be clear, there aren't things you've never seen before in the movie. I mean, you know the characters are going to bond at some point. And people will grow to care about each other. That's a given. How we get there, however, is what makes the film seem fresh and entertaining and ever bit as good as any flick made back in the day.I hope more people see it."
"The Holdovers","tdwillis-26273","7 December 2023",810,"Finally......a GOOD movie. The story/script, although not a breakthrough idea, was heartfelt,full and real.The settings were also real and gorgeous (not really a cgi fan)
Camera, cinematography, lighting,sound,score....every level made my eyes and ears satisfyingly full.Acting was oscarworthy across the board.Directing was brilliant.Only negative I can come up with is that the pace was a bit slow, but so much of the movie is so focused and so superbly and beautifully made I just sat back and enjoyed it.A very thoughtful substantial and beautiful movie. A rare gem in today's superficial gimmicky movie making world."
"The Holdovers","ferguson-6","8 November 2023",810,"Greetings again from the darkness. We've all had that teacher. You know, the one with an evil streak who just seemed to thrive on making students miserable. Throw in a staff and administrators who feel the same way, and the casting choice for the teacher becomes obvious. Enter the always great and perfectly curmudgeonly Paul Giamatti. This is the first time Giamatti has worked with two-time Oscar winner Alexander Payne since their brilliant SIDEWAYS (2004), and it's clear these two share a wavelength for comedy and drama, even in throwback form.Paul Hunham (Giamatti) is a long-time professor at Barton Academy, an all-boys private prep school located in the snowy northeast. It's December 1970, and an early scene exemplifies how he relishes the failing grades he bestows upon desperate students so afraid to disappoint their rich parents. In the final class before the holiday break, the student-teacher banter doesn't go so well for the boys, and they head to break with an extra workload. Hunham is easily manipulated into babysitting the titular holdovers - students stuck at school over the break, while most others spend time with family, often on exotic trips.Initially there are five students, but after a certain development, what remains is Hunham, smart but troubled Angus Tully (first timer Dominic Sessa) and the school's head cook, Mary Lamb (a divine Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019). Hunham is perpetually annoyed and has a weakness for booze. Angus is frustrated that his mother left him at school so she could travel with her new husband, and Mary is grieving over her son who was killed in Vietnam. Watching these three struggle to bond is a case study in psychology, yet of course we know they will ultimately form a family of misfits, depending on each other to offset the loneliness.The genius tagline for the film is ""Discomfort and Joy"", and initially the first overshadows the latter. Isolated from the world in their own way, the three characters begin to influence each other, showing broken/wounded people need and deserve love and friendship as much as anyone else. ""Entre nous"" (just between us) becomes a kind of calling card for this trio, and a Christmas party thrown by an eternally optimistic staffer (Carrie Preston) is a turning point.Giamatti is master of this material and only goes over the top a time or two. It's painful and humorous each time he is so anxious to infuse his breadth of ancient civilization facts into even the most mundane conversations. Newcomer Sessa possesses star potential and nails a complex first role. Da'Vine Joy Randolph's Mary is the heart of the film, doling out advice to Hunham and comfort to Angus. Depression is a vein running through these characters and it's acknowledged, though not the focus.This is Alexander Payne's first film since the disappointing DOWNSIZING (2017), but his brilliance has been proven in ABOUT SCHMIDT (2002), SIDEWAYS (2004), THE DESCENDANTS (2011), and NEBRASKA (2013). This time he's working from a screenplay by successful TV writer, David Hemingson, and though there is never much suspense about where the story or characters are headed, we enjoy the ride immensely. Cinematography from Eigil Byrld (IN BRUGES, 2008), perfectly complements the emotions (shot on digital, graininess added in post), and the soundtrack is period-specific, including the great Cat Stevens. Pay attention to the retro opening credits and logos, and enjoy a smart and funny film (an Alexander Payne trademark).Opening in theaters November 10, 2023."
"The Holdovers","akcenat","1 January 2024",810,"""The Holdovers"" is a captivating blend of comedy and drama that beautifully explores the complexities of human relationships.Story is about a grumpy instructor (Paul Giamatti) at a New England prep school who forms an unexpected bond with a troubled student during the Christmas break. Because it is set in the 1970s, the film in a way is a nostalgic journey back in time, but with a narrative that is both engaging and thought-provoking.The performances are exceptional, with Giamatti delivering a compelling portrayal of a man grappling with his own loneliness and the challenges of mentorship. The film's narrative is richly layered, exploring themes of loneliness, friendship, and personal growth. It's a story that resonates, offering a poignant reflection on the human condition. The film's setting in the 1970s adds a layer of nostalgia, further enhancing the emotional depth of the narrative. Despite its lengthy runtime, ""The Holdovers"" mostly maintains a steady pace, balancing its dramatic elements with moments of humor and warmth. The main plus of the movie is its dialogue-driven approach that adds to its charm, creating a sense of authenticity and depth in its character interactions.Overall, this is a film that leaves a lasting impression, offering a thoughtful exploration of human relationships set against the backdrop of a bygone era. With its exceptional performances and engaging narrative, I'm giving it an 8 out of 10 rating. It's a must-watch for those seeking a film that combines drama, comedy, and a touch of nostalgia."
"The Holdovers","Quinoa1984","30 October 2023",1010,"The Holdovers is, for all of the character dynamics and dysfunction and depression and other things we find out about the leads, mostly with Mr. Hunham and Angus and how their characters over these couple of weeks turn away from the ""Barton"" way of not telling lies (because, well, sometimes context and the moment matter for telling a lie that won't really hurt, maybe), a strangely comforting film to watch. Not for all of that exactly, though what we understand slowly but surely is this is all material for comedy and tragedy in equal measure, but because of the feeling that we get with a filmmaker who is so primed and confident with material that you don't feel like it can go wrong.What is more impressive is that, as enjoyable as the first half is, it is in the ""I like this"" mode as we are introduced to this world and Hunham and Angus and Mary, but it doesn't feel so special. But I should have known Payne and writer David Hemingson were laying down the necessary groundwork for what comes the moment a) the majority of the other supporting characters leave for reasons I don't have to mention here, and b) then the characters go outside the Barton campus grounds on a holiday party and then a ""field trip"" to Boston, you get the sense moment by moment and interaction by interaction it is so sharp and cutting and wise, and one scene in particular makes the jump into ""oh, OK, this is taking off into another level of personal pain and about familial expectations and what will come with in a life measuring up to others - and why that is wrong - and... yeah, it's great"" territory.In other words, it's the kind of film I want to watch again right away simply because now that I know a little more about the characters, I'll want to experience all of the extra textures (its 1970 down to the wood paneling and the car seats), and dig a little more into those absolutely wonderful natural restrained and complete performances - we take Giamatti for granted sometimes and this is a character he should be proud of to craft, lazy-ass eyes and all; Sessa's first role and he is an immediate star; I can't be more sure of anything for the next Oscar's that, if Randolph is nominated, she will win, if nothing else for everything she does at the Christmas party scenes, and a moment looking over some objects in a room later on is so moving - and my comfort is in seeing Payne clearly loving directing this intimate character study where he can show what a comedically observant, quick witted, and heartbreaking story this all is.It's one of the best Christmas movies in several years, embodying many themes and ideals that fit like a 70s wool sweater, and I'm sure the first thing Payne must have thought after reading the script was ""whoa. This is gonna be the best Hal Ashby or Bob Rafelson movie never made... is 'The Last Holdover' too on the nose?"" Even Hunham would give this... a B+ probably (did he ever give As? Shrug)."
"The Holdovers","jjgonzalez-06426","31 October 2023",910,"Quite possibly one of the best Christmas films ever? I first saw Payne & Giamatti's previous film together, ""Sideways"" during my screenwriting training class, and it is one that I would think of for a while. Their new film, ""The Holdovers"", is hilarious, beautifully shot and acted, heartwarming, and has a great sense of grief and joy meshed together. Definitely leaning towards Randolph for Best Supporting Actress; her performance BLEW me away.Overall, I love these films. Light-hearted & comedic while also have a sense of darkness and a lot of heavy emotion to it. Definitely is one of the most heartfelt films of the year."
"The Holdovers","paul-allaer","20 November 2023",810,"As ""The Holdovers"" (2023 release; 133 min.) opens, it's 1970 and we are at the Barton HS boarding school in New England as the Fall semester wraps up. Paul Hunham, a teacher of classical studies and a curmudgeon, gets summoned by the head of school, and is told he will take charge of the 4 or 5 ""holdovers"", students who for one reason or another, cannot go home and need to stay at the boarding school for the entire Christmas break... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest from director Alexander Payne (""Sideways"", ""The Descendants""). Here he brings to the big screen what life is like in Fall of 1970 among a group of privileged HS students along with their testy classics teacher and a Black woman who runs the kitchen. On the surface of it all, this looks to be a terrible combination, but as the movie plays out, more and more is revealed. The movie is plot-heavy and I shan't say another word on that. Paul Giamatti, a regular of Payne's prior movie work, brings what I feel is one of his strongest movie roles ever. Da'Vine Joy Randolph is outstanding as the Black kitchen supervisor with a heavy heart. Dominic Sessa is frankly too old (33 in real life) to play the rebellious HS student Angus (17 in the movie), I mean, it's really really obvious. That said, Payne just hits all the right notes in this film, and this resonated with me on so many levels. Despite the serious undertones, there are quite a few funny moments in the movie as well.""The Holdovers"" premiered a few months ago at the Telluride film festival to immediate and widespread critical acclaim. There is good reason why this is currently rated 87% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. The movie opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati the weekend before last. The early Sunday evening screening where I saw this at was attended so-so (about 12-15 people). If you are in the mood for a top-notch comedy drama, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion."
"The Holdovers","imseeg","14 December 2023",610,"I am big fan of director Alexander Payne (The Descendants, Sideways) and of actor Paul Giamatti in particular. Both have teamed up before with marvellous results, but this movie has got 1 problem that made me only rate it with 6 stars though:The bad:the middle part of this story stretches out too long, with several quite tedious scenes, which could have easily been cut out of it without hurting the storyline. I started watching at my watch half way through several times because of this lack of spark and punch. Such a pity!Fortunately this movie picked up momentum again towards the warmhearted Christmas spirited final, but I still will only award this movie with 6 stars (instead of 7) because I got bored at many moments during the somewhat tedious and long middle part.The story: It's about a young student and his teacher, who both are lonely souls and although they cant stand each other at first, eventually slowly do bond with each other during a Christmas holiday. Acting by Paul Giamatti is masterful (as always), BUT some of the other actors fail to impress me.Not the best of director Alexander Payne's work, but definitely still worth a watch, because it left me in my seat with a smile on my face and a feel good Christmas spirit of caring for one another!"
"The Holdovers","cparousis-30615","1 January 2024",1010,"Sad, poignant, funny, and beautiful are words that best describe this film. If this film doesn't make you feel sone kind of emotion, you are absolutely heartless. You love these characters. You feel for them on every single level. The film itself feels like a film from the 70s. The twists and turns the film takes are wonderful and heartwarming/heartbreaking. Paul Giamatti is excellent as always. This is Dominic Sessa's first film and he does an outstanding job. No crazy special effects or bloated explosions. Just great filmmaking. It's streaming on Peacock. An absolute holiday must. Take the time to watch it. You'll love it."
"The Holdovers","arfdawg-1","26 December 2023",510,"Lots of great reviews here. Many people who have seen Sideways seem to be excited that Giamatti has re-teamed with Payne the director.Of course, the film is in no way related to the other movie, except that both were involved and that Sideways has quite a cult following.Unfortunately this is not my type of movie. I'm not saying it's bad. And I'm not saying anything bad about the people who seem to love it. It's just not for me.It's a character driven movie, which is fine, except I didnt bond with any of the characters. And I found the choice of musical tunes throughout to be annoying at best.So if you like drawn out period piece character driven flicks, you may like this one. I didn't love it, but I could see how some might, hence the ""5"" rating."
"The Holdovers","kevin_robbins","31 December 2023",910,"My wife and I watched The Holdovers (2023) on Peacock last night. The storyline unfolds at a boarding school in Massachusetts during holiday vacation, focusing on the kids with nowhere to go for the holidays and the staff assigned to care for them, who happen to be facing a similar issue. Together, they work to uncover inner demons and find a way to release them, allowing everyone to truly enjoy the holiday season.Directed by Alexander Payne (Sideways), the film stars Paul Giamatti (American Splendor), Da'Vine Joy Randolph (Dolemite is my Name), Dominic Sessa, and Carrie Preston (Claws).This is an exceptionally unique holiday film, offering intriguing settings, characters, and circumstances. All facets are fascinating and worthwhile, with outstanding writing that establishes the storyline and various subplots effectively. The dialogue is absolutely superb, featuring a well-balanced blend of raw emotion, character development, and comedy. The eyebrow-raising conclusion is perfect for the characters' concluding direction.In conclusion, The Holdovers is a unique and captivating character piece that's an absolute must-see. I would score this a 9/10 and strongly recommend it."
"The Holdovers","euroGary","19 October 2023",1010,"One does not expect a Christmas film to be challenging, and this one certainly isn't. But it is a lot of fun.A boys' boarding school empties of almost all staff and pupils for the 1970/1 Festive Season. Left behind are Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti), the unpopular history teacher who has to keep an eye on the school; Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa), a teenaged pupil whose mother does not want him on her honeymoon; and Mary Lamb (the impressively-named Da'Vine Joy Randolph), the school cook who is facing her first Christmas alone since her son died on military service. As these three lonely souls come together, there are tantrums, emotional revelations, the revealing of long-hidden secrets, a noble sacrifice... the usual stuff.Also the usual stuff are the characters: Paul is cynical and frustrated; Angus is ironic and insecure; and as Mary is overweight and black, she of course has to be sassy.But while in some films such predictability would be annoying, it works here. Within the limits of their somewhat two-dimensional personalities, the characters are well-written - even Angus' tantrums do not seem unreasonable. Plus, there are some great gags (""You hit him? You mean you punched him out?"" ""No, I hit him with a car..."") And I will not be the only viewer who finishes the film with a lump in his throat.Great fun. I can easily see myself buying the DVD and watching this for many Christmases to come..."
"The Holdovers","cherold","31 December 2023",810,"This movie is about a handful of entitled boys who regretfully must stay behind during the Christmas break at their private school and the teacher and cook there to oversee them.It's a funny and affecting movie with excellent performances from the leads, especially Paul giamatti as the prickly teacher.It's a Christmas movie of sorts, since it does take place at Christmas, but it's really more of an anytime of the year film in which you get to see people have adventures and fight and grow and that sort of thing.It's very well filmed, it's very entertaining, and I would recommend you watch it."
"The Holdovers","bastille-852-731547","29 October 2023",610,"Set in December 1970, ""The Holdovers"" follows a small group of students who have to stay on campus over the Christmas break at Barton Academy (a prestigious boarding school in Massachusetts,) alongside a curmudgeonly ancient history teacher (Paul Giamatti.) That sounds like a potentially amusing premise for a breezy comedy-drama, especially when Alexander Payne is directing. Having greatly enjoyed and admired several of Payne's previous films such as ""Sideways,"" ""The Descendants,"" and ""Nebraska,"" I was looking forward to this film. Overall, I found it to be simply fine and not up to par with the level of quality of most of Payne's films. There's nothing too wrong with it by any stretch of the imagination, but it's often generic and forgettable compared to Payne's other films.An indie dramedy like this film would generally be expected to be defined by being character- and writing-driven. Unfortunately, neither the characters nor the writing here are especially unique enough to structure a compelling plot around. Paul (Giamatti's character) is very generic, as is the rebellious student Angus, whose relationship with Paul is a pivotal part of the film. On a better note, Da'Vine Joy Randolph gives a strong and impactful performance as Mary, a cafeteria worker dealing with bereavement; her character is interestingly more dynamic and multi-dimensional than either Paul or Angus. The writing and humor is less unique, funny, or engaging than many of Payne's films, as the attempts at plot devices, character development, and humor often boil down to insult comedy between Paul and Angus--which, ultimately, wears out its welcome a bit, and actually causes a bit of collateral damage in making the film's tone and story feel less sincere. Regardless of the sincerity of the story, another thing that is clear here is that there needed to be a stronger and less predictable core to the plot in order for the film to remain engaging for its 133-minute runtime.The film's retro, 1970s-aesthetic is commendable and helps contribute to the atmosphere of the film, and there still are some sporadic sweet moments of Paul and Mary hanging out around the television and a few decent jokes here and there. So ""The Holdovers"" is a fine enough film, but it won't be a new holiday classic for me. 6/10."
"The Holdovers","RahulM007","31 October 2023",1010,"""Penis cancer in human form.""Alexander Payne's ""The Holdovers"" is a laugh-out-loud comedy strengthened by Paul Giamatti and Dominic Sessa's magnetic performances and their incredible chemistry together. I am in awe by the film's brilliant and inventive screenplay, 70s-style cinematography, slick editing, and great production design. I could watch Paul and Angus bicker for another two hours. Throughout the film, the humour gets more interwoven leading to a crescendo of hilarity. ""The Holdovers"" offers the perfect blend of humor and pathos.*That waitress was so rude for refusing to accept their order of cherries jubilee. She is a fascist and a ""penis cancer in human form"".*The film reminded me of Peter Weir's ""Dead Poets Society"", Milos Forman's ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", and John Hughes' ""The Breakfast Club"" (kind of).Final verdict: 10/10."
"The Holdovers","Avwillfan89","29 November 2023",910,"Finally, Alexander Payne has made a worthy follow up to his (in my opinion at least) masterpiece Sideways.I really related so much to all three of the main characters, who all come from different backgrounds. Paul Giamatti, brilliant in almost anything he does, plays a grumpy, alcoholic, sour professor who does not suffer fools and doesn't cut his privileged students any slack. Dominic Sessa is troubled teen with a dysfunctional family and mental issues. D'Avine Joy Randolf is a grieving mother stuck in a job wanting to make ends meet for her family, by her choice.This movie has great character development, a wholesome story with flawed yet lovable characters you can root for and terrific, funny dialogue. Simple, yet perfect. 9 out of 10."
"The Holdovers","frankde-jong","27 December 2023",910,"I had a lot of associations when I started watching ""The holdovers"".Kids stuck in a school during the Christmas vacation, is that not a little bit like ""The breakfast club"" (1985, John Hughes)? No, because most of the kids go away early in the film and we are left with just one pupil (Angus Tully played by Dominic Sessa) and a teacher (Paul Hunham played by Paul Giamatti).Paul Hunham teaches ancient languages and culture. Does that sounds like the Donna Tartt novel ""The secret history"" (1992)? No, in that novel the pupils are inspired by their teacher. In ""The holdovers"" the teacher is hated.One association that I did not have at all prior to watching the movie may be the most accurate: ""Scent of a woman"" (1992, Martin Brest). Also in this film a high school pupil on an expensive boarding school and a grumpy old man are condemned to each other.Best of all however we can see ""The holdovers"" as the comeback of Alexander Payne after his failed film ""Downsizing"" (2017). The film is situated in 1970 and has a very 70's look and feel, down to the aspect ratio then used. The film also contains very beautiful images of Norteast American landscapes.First of all however the film is about its three main characters. Apart from the two already introduced we have the chief cook of the boarding school Mary Lamb (Da'Vine Joy Randolph). These three people form a sort of substitute family that has to spend the Christmas season together. Each of them has his/her problems but during the film they grow closer to each other, or at least learn to understand each other better.Being a Christmas movie you expect a happy ending and somewhere in the middle of the film this happy ending seems to consist of all the members of the proxy family being on their way towards an unexpected romance. The greatness of the film is that these romances do not materialize fully. The message of the film seems to be that gaining better understanding is a happy enough ending.By the way the film does not shy away from some social criticism. The character of Paul Hunham is meant to be grumpy at first, but to me he was instantly sympathetic when he made the headmaster of the boarding school very clear that in his class wealthy parents could not buy good grades for their sons. Later he says to his pupils (at that stage of the film there are still a couple of them) that they ought to be aware of their privileged status. ""You go to Harvard, poorer boys go to Vietnam"". The Vietnam war plays an important role in the background anyway. The son of the chief cook has died in Vietnam and while visiting a bar in the village nearby the boarding school there is a local boy that lost one of his hands in Vietnam.All in all ""The holdovers"" is a very convincing comeback of Alexander Payne. He made an instant Christmas classic!"
"The Holdovers","210west","14 January 2024",410,"Alexander Payne's 1999 comedy ""Election,"" set in a Midwestern high school, was brilliant, sometimes painful, sometimes hilarious. Best of all (I say this as a onetime high school teacher), it felt refreshingly authentic.""The Holdovers"" is quite the opposite: contrived, predictable, and intended to teach -- you guessed it -- a little lesson in compassion. An hour into it, I realized that it hadn't yet contained a single moment that seemed genuine, much less surprising. Every line of dialogue sounds phony. Characters speak in little announcements, spelling things out for us. Some of the characters -- a couple of menacing townies, for example -- are mere cartoons.Giamatti's protagonist is a wholly artificial creation, designed as if in a screenwriting course to follow the approved character arc -- initially stuffy and unsympathetic to the point of caricature, ultimately vulnerable. Ironically, an early scene between him and the school's headmaster violates what's sometimes regarded as a screenwriting rule: Do NOT, even in the interest of exposition, have people telling each other what they already know. (The by-the-numbers triteness of that conversation -- meant to show us that the instructor is uncompromising and pedantic but possesses old-fashioned integrity, blah blah blah -- put me off from the start.) The scenes between Giamatti and the school's cook -- in which, with the audience in mind, the two provide personal backstories and reveal their inner selves -- are painfully heavy-handed and at times so gooey that I felt sorry for the actress: ""You can't even dream a whole dream, can you?"" she is made to say at one point. ""What are you afraid of?""Yes, I know, everybody seems to love the movie. I could barely stomach it. But do check out ""Election."""
"The Holdovers","bdesdes","30 October 2023",810,"Very enjoyable film with outstanding performances and a wonderful warm vibe accompanied by the Christmas season. It's funny at times, sad at times, and feel-good. It's a story that almost all can relate to and will really touch your heart. It deals with so many themes, but mainly grief, the past, family, and what makes a person who they are. It's also very original and has a great script, cinematography, and soundtrack. I would highly advise to see it in the theaters as well as you really get the 70's vibe and deep moment on the big screen. There aren't many negatives to this film and I would recommend it to most people."
"The Holdovers","aharmas","29 October 2023",1010,"Here is a film that feels and looks like something out of the early seventies. The Holdovers is a strong and warm-hearted piece that gives actors roles with powerful lines, without any reliance on flashy editing and being overwhelmed by special effects.The story is simple three people get stuck for the Christmas holidays in a boarding school. It's cold, lonely, and boring for the parties involved. The adults drink to cope with whatever pressures they live with. The young man resorts to bad behavior and altercations with the teacher in charge.Through the vacation period these people will get to interact and get to know each other, something that will prove to a challenge to say the least. As the story evolves, we get to understand what has made the people who they are. We get to feel their pain and frustration through the very insightful writing of the director.It's a strong film with superb acting by the main leads. They have great chemistry together.Most outstanding is Paul Giamatti who plays the tormented and defensive man with relish and speaks volumes with his eyes.Hope the academy honors his performance as the best the year because no one else so far is coming close."
"The Holdovers","darkreignn","29 October 2023",910,"Let's just get this out of the way now - when it comes to writing this review, I'm probably a little bit biased (and a little bit drunk, currently, but that's besides the point). You see, I have an affinity for indie coming of age movies, and ""The Holdovers"" is basically an indie coming of age film, so it may - or may not - come as a surprise to you that I absolutely adored this picture. So, with that little preface out of the way, it's time for me to gush over this movie.Starring none other than Paul Giamatti as Paul Hunham, Giamatti plays a professor at an all boys boarding school where, over Christmas break, he has the misfortune of looking over a group of boys, one of whom is named Angus, played by Dominic Sessa. After a rocky start, where Paul clearly doesn't get along with any of the boys, making his disdain clear and evident, he eventually finds himself alone with Angus - as well as with the school's cook, Mary Lamb, played by Da'Vine Joy Randolph - in an unexpected chain of events. What occurs after is a slice-of-life style piece of cinema that allows broken people to find comfort in each other's company.""The Holdovers"" is, without a doubt, one of my favorite movies of 2023, as well as probably one of the best movies of the year, as well. This Christmas-themed gem doesn't hold back on the drama, delivering a thoughtful blend of comedy, coming-of-age storytelling, and a touch of romance - all wrapped around a very raw, human plot-line that virtually everyone can relate to. I'm no spring chicken myself, but I found myself deeply connected to both main characters - one who is older and basically dejected with life as he knows it, and one who is younger but who feels lost, aimless, and disconnected from both family and friends. And admittedly, not everyone will have a direct parallel to these experiences, but even if you don't, you're in for a story that's bound to tug at your heartstrings... and make you laugh out loud in the process.This is a high-quality movie - from the impeccable acting to the beautiful on-location cinematography to the relatable, thought-provoking plot, every element is executed with pinpoint precision and finesse; it's a testament to the art of storytelling on the silver screen. Director Alexander Payne knows how to create an artful film, and ""The Holdovers"" is no exception. It's at once indie and art-house while simultaneously being mainstream and easily accessible; in short, it's a film for everyone that actually feels like a genuine crowdpleaser instead of a pandering mess.I'm having a difficult time describing what I liked about this movie, and the reason is because I liked almost everything about this movie. So why the 9 out of 10 rating instead of the perfect 10? Literally the only thing that's holding me back is because I would've liked a touch more romance; yes, there was romance here, but a bit more would've pushed me over the edge into 10 out of 10 territory. Besides that, this is basically a perfect film, one that I loved, and one that has become one of my favorite movies of the year, if not of all time. I am genuinely looking forward to rewatching this, and I can't wait until it becomes closer to Christmas so I can view this on my own TV, cuddled under blankets, with a glass of whiskey, and bask in the absolute heartwarming experience that is ""The Holdovers."" My recommendation: Do yourself a favor and watch this as soon as you can - you won't regret it."
"The Holdovers","evanston_dad","20 November 2023",1010,"Mid-way through ""The Holdovers,"" I started openly weeping in the movie theater, and I pretty much kept it up on and off for the rest of the movie. Sometimes, there wasn't even anything obviously sad or moving happening in the scene, and I still couldn't stop. I think it's because this movie is so kind, and kindness is a rare commodity these days. It's sad to think that a movie about characters learning to have compassion for each other and for the hardships they've been through should feel like such a rare beast, but here we are.This is Alexander Payne firing on all cylinders as a director, and though he didn't write this movie, it feels like he could have. It's an obvious throwback to the kinds of movies Hal Ashby made throughout the 1970s and is touching in exactly the same way ""Harold and Maude"" was. It's also a master class in acting from the three principal characters played by Paul Giamatti, Dominic Sessa, and Da 'Vine Joy Randolph, and I hope all three of them, and the movie overall, is remembered come Oscar time.This will easily make my top ten list for the year.Grade: A+"
"The Holdovers","Xstal","28 November 2023",810,"Now here's a film with a life affirming theme, that should encourage most viewers to think of their dreams, and cascade away all their cloaks, inhibitions, and open fresh doors to their heart's intuitions; as a teacher whose life is as stale as dead fish, whose life is the opposite of happy and bliss, meets a boy who's ignored by all those he holds dear, and a friendship is formed that is warm and sincere; it's a subtle reflection of how we get trapped, by tradition and habits and past circumstance, where surroundings like prisons can temper our thinking, to distil all our spirit, to bottles for drinking; so embrace all the chances when they come along, break out of that mould and sing your own song, open your eyes to the paths unexplored, take a stand and stand tall, and stop being ignored."
"The Holdovers","steiner-sam","10 November 2023",910,"It's a comedy-drama set from December 16, 1970, to the first week of January 1971 in an exclusive boy's boarding school in New England and Boston, Massachusetts. It follows the experiences of the ""holdovers,"" that is, the students who cannot go home over the Christmas holidays and the two Barton staff left to supervise them during the holidays.There are five holdovers: Teddy Kountze (Brady Hepner), Jason Smith (Michael Provost), and Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa) are upper-class wealthy WASP students. Alex Ollerman (Ian Dolley) is a younger Mormon student whose parents are on a mission in South America. Ye-Joon Park (Jim Kaplan) is from South Korea.Left to supervise is Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti), an unmarried ancient history teacher who was once a student at Barton and has taught there all his career. He's a demanding curmudgeon who almost everyone dislikes. African American Mary Lamb (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), the head cook, is also present; her son, a Barton grad, has just been killed in Vietnam.The film follows the shared experiences of the holdovers, though four students leave after a week when a wealthy father takes them for a ski holiday. Paul cannot contact Angus's parents, so he must stay with Paul and Mary at Barton. We also meet the school's headmaster, Hardy Woodrup (Andrew Garman), his administrative assistant, Lydia Crane (Carrie Preston), and janitor Danny (Naheem Garcia).""The Holdovers"" is a delightful comedy leavened with wisdom as we learn the dark secrets that have shaped Paul Hunham and Angus Tully. Giamatti, Sessa, and Randolph are all excellent. The script unfolds the twists and turns superbly. ""The Holdovers"" is a great Christmas movie."
"The Holdovers","JohnDeSando","16 November 2023",NA,"""I find the world a bitter and complicated place. And it seems to feel the same way about me."" Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti)Teaching privileged boys at an elite new England prep school called Barton (think for example, Philips Exeter), might be the pinnacle of an academic's career. But not Paul Hunham in The Holdovers, an elite movie itself of the year.Paul should be teaching classics at an ivy school, not teaching entitled ""vermin,"" among the many sobriquets he tosses around about the fortunate young men to experience his brand of grumpy intellectualism and misanthropy. He prepares them for a world that won't always be coddling and protecting them as their family wealth so naturally does in their early years.Director Alexander Payne worked with Giamatti in Sideways, so he is prepared to have another winning cynical character who is endearing while distanced by negative temperament from normally positive fellow humans (Paul's last name, Hunham, suggests a distant connection with the better angels of humanity).As Paul accepts the assignment to supervise holdovers (exiled to Christmas vacation in the absence of parents or guardians), the number whittles down to just Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa, reminiscent of young, Timothy Chalamet and Adam Driver), who shares Paul's dark attitudes and, with the sharp writing of David Hemingson, some witty dialogue- e.g., about Paul he says, ""I thought all of the Nazis had left for Argentina.""Although, as in likeminded dramas such as Dead Poet's Society or Goodbye, Mr. Chips, the principals are destined to be transformed into more humane characters, Holdovers continues, even in its denouement, to accentuate the unsunny side of life for Paul and Tully, whose fortunes are still compromised by cold-hearted parents and administrators. The chilly world, however, is warmed on these lovely, snowbound days, by women, viz., the cook, Mary (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) and administrator Lydia (Carrie Preston).Mary good-naturedly deals with the death of her son, Curtis, a Barton grad who had to join the military because he did not have the resources as other Barton grads of the late '60s did to avoid the draft.Lydia, an attractive middle-aged staff member, holds the promise of a love interest for Paul, only to show how difficult it is for social exiles to enter the romantic mainstream.The Holdovers is a small gem of a move that will immediately remind buffs about Hal Ashby comedies of the same era like Harold & Maude, where character development is paramount and detachment from the mainstream is required to look at humanity clearly with its foibles and endearments.The Holdovers is a movie everyone can enjoy with endearing characters who share with us our moments about loneliness peppered with the possibilities of love and happiness.""Do you think I want to be babysitting you? No. I was praying your mother would pick up the phone, or your father would arrive in a helicopter or a flying saucer...."" Paul Hunham."
"The Holdovers","dtswpod","6 November 2023",810,"Do you miss how they used to make films in the 1970s? Plenty of filmmakers do, except they take that nostalgia and just do watered down versions of better movies. As an example see Taxi Driver and King of Comedy then watch Joker and you'll get what I mean.Thankfully, Alexander Payne has managed to take his sentimentality and make an original film out of it. Or if The Holdovers is a pale imitation of a superior picture then the filmmaker has managed to trick me because I don't feel as if I've seen this movie before but done better.Now to be clear, there aren't things you've never seen before in the movie. I mean, you know the characters are going to bond at some point. And people will grow to care about each other. That's a given. How we get there, however, is what makes the film seem fresh and entertaining and ever bit as good as any flick made back in the day.I hope more people see it."

"The Holdovers","ferguson-6","8 November 2023",810,"Greetings again from the darkness. We've all had that teacher. You know, the one with an evil streak who just seemed to thrive on making students miserable. Throw in a staff and administrators who feel the same way, and the casting choice for the teacher becomes obvious. Enter the always great and perfectly curmudgeonly Paul Giamatti. This is the first time Giamatti has worked with two-time Oscar winner Alexander Payne since their brilliant SIDEWAYS (2004), and it's clear these two share a wavelength for comedy and drama, even in throwback form.Paul Hunham (Giamatti) is a long-time professor at Barton Academy, an all-boys private prep school located in the snowy northeast. It's December 1970, and an early scene exemplifies how he relishes the failing grades he bestows upon desperate students so afraid to disappoint their rich parents. In the final class before the holiday break, the student-teacher banter doesn't go so well for the boys, and they head to break with an extra workload. Hunham is easily manipulated into babysitting the titular holdovers - students stuck at school over the break, while most others spend time with family, often on exotic trips.Initially there are five students, but after a certain development, what remains is Hunham, smart but troubled Angus Tully (first timer Dominic Sessa) and the school's head cook, Mary Lamb (a divine Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019). Hunham is perpetually annoyed and has a weakness for booze. Angus is frustrated that his mother left him at school so she could travel with her new husband, and Mary is grieving over her son who was killed in Vietnam. Watching these three struggle to bond is a case study in psychology, yet of course we know they will ultimately form a family of misfits, depending on each other to offset the loneliness.The genius tagline for the film is ""Discomfort and Joy"", and initially the first overshadows the latter. Isolated from the world in their own way, the three characters begin to influence each other, showing broken/wounded people need and deserve love and friendship as much as anyone else. ""Entre nous"" (just between us) becomes a kind of calling card for this trio, and a Christmas party thrown by an eternally optimistic staffer (Carrie Preston) is a turning point.Giamatti is master of this material and only goes over the top a time or two. It's painful and humorous each time he is so anxious to infuse his breadth of ancient civilization facts into even the most mundane conversations. Newcomer Sessa possesses star potential and nails a complex first role. Da'Vine Joy Randolph's Mary is the heart of the film, doling out advice to Hunham and comfort to Angus. Depression is a vein running through these characters and it's acknowledged, though not the focus.This is Alexander Payne's first film since the disappointing DOWNSIZING (2017), but his brilliance has been proven in ABOUT SCHMIDT (2002), SIDEWAYS (2004), THE DESCENDANTS (2011), and NEBRASKA (2013). This time he's working from a screenplay by successful TV writer, David Hemingson, and though there is never much suspense about where the story or characters are headed, we enjoy the ride immensely. Cinematography from Eigil Byrld (IN BRUGES, 2008), perfectly complements the emotions (shot on digital, graininess added in post), and the soundtrack is period-specific, including the great Cat Stevens. Pay attention to the retro opening credits and logos, and enjoy a smart and funny film (an Alexander Payne trademark).Opening in theaters November 10, 2023."
"The Holdovers","akcenat","1 January 2024",810,"""The Holdovers"" is a captivating blend of comedy and drama that beautifully explores the complexities of human relationships.Story is about a grumpy instructor (Paul Giamatti) at a New England prep school who forms an unexpected bond with a troubled student during the Christmas break. Because it is set in the 1970s, the film in a way is a nostalgic journey back in time, but with a narrative that is both engaging and thought-provoking.The performances are exceptional, with Giamatti delivering a compelling portrayal of a man grappling with his own loneliness and the challenges of mentorship. The film's narrative is richly layered, exploring themes of loneliness, friendship, and personal growth. It's a story that resonates, offering a poignant reflection on the human condition. The film's setting in the 1970s adds a layer of nostalgia, further enhancing the emotional depth of the narrative. Despite its lengthy runtime, ""The Holdovers"" mostly maintains a steady pace, balancing its dramatic elements with moments of humor and warmth. The main plus of the movie is its dialogue-driven approach that adds to its charm, creating a sense of authenticity and depth in its character interactions.Overall, this is a film that leaves a lasting impression, offering a thoughtful exploration of human relationships set against the backdrop of a bygone era. With its exceptional performances and engaging narrative, I'm giving it an 8 out of 10 rating. It's a must-watch for those seeking a film that combines drama, comedy, and a touch of nostalgia."
"The Holdovers","Quinoa1984","30 October 2023",1010,"The Holdovers is, for all of the character dynamics and dysfunction and depression and other things we find out about the leads, mostly with Mr. Hunham and Angus and how their characters over these couple of weeks turn away from the ""Barton"" way of not telling lies (because, well, sometimes context and the moment matter for telling a lie that won't really hurt, maybe), a strangely comforting film to watch. Not for all of that exactly, though what we understand slowly but surely is this is all material for comedy and tragedy in equal measure, but because of the feeling that we get with a filmmaker who is so primed and confident with material that you don't feel like it can go wrong.What is more impressive is that, as enjoyable as the first half is, it is in the ""I like this"" mode as we are introduced to this world and Hunham and Angus and Mary, but it doesn't feel so special. But I should have known Payne and writer David Hemingson were laying down the necessary groundwork for what comes the moment a) the majority of the other supporting characters leave for reasons I don't have to mention here, and b) then the characters go outside the Barton campus grounds on a holiday party and then a ""field trip"" to Boston, you get the sense moment by moment and interaction by interaction it is so sharp and cutting and wise, and one scene in particular makes the jump into ""oh, OK, this is taking off into another level of personal pain and about familial expectations and what will come with in a life measuring up to others - and why that is wrong - and... yeah, it's great"" territory.In other words, it's the kind of film I want to watch again right away simply because now that I know a little more about the characters, I'll want to experience all of the extra textures (its 1970 down to the wood paneling and the car seats), and dig a little more into those absolutely wonderful natural restrained and complete performances - we take Giamatti for granted sometimes and this is a character he should be proud of to craft, lazy-ass eyes and all; Sessa's first role and he is an immediate star; I can't be more sure of anything for the next Oscar's that, if Randolph is nominated, she will win, if nothing else for everything she does at the Christmas party scenes, and a moment looking over some objects in a room later on is so moving - and my comfort is in seeing Payne clearly loving directing this intimate character study where he can show what a comedically observant, quick witted, and heartbreaking story this all is.It's one of the best Christmas movies in several years, embodying many themes and ideals that fit like a 70s wool sweater, and I'm sure the first thing Payne must have thought after reading the script was ""whoa. This is gonna be the best Hal Ashby or Bob Rafelson movie never made... is 'The Last Holdover' too on the nose?"" Even Hunham would give this... a B+ probably (did he ever give As? Shrug)."
"The Holdovers","jjgonzalez-06426","31 October 2023",910,"Quite possibly one of the best Christmas films ever? I first saw Payne & Giamatti's previous film together, ""Sideways"" during my screenwriting training class, and it is one that I would think of for a while. Their new film, ""The Holdovers"", is hilarious, beautifully shot and acted, heartwarming, and has a great sense of grief and joy meshed together. Definitely leaning towards Randolph for Best Supporting Actress; her performance BLEW me away.Overall, I love these films. Light-hearted & comedic while also have a sense of darkness and a lot of heavy emotion to it. Definitely is one of the most heartfelt films of the year."
"The Holdovers","paul-allaer","20 November 2023",810,"As ""The Holdovers"" (2023 release; 133 min.) opens, it's 1970 and we are at the Barton HS boarding school in New England as the Fall semester wraps up. Paul Hunham, a teacher of classical studies and a curmudgeon, gets summoned by the head of school, and is told he will take charge of the 4 or 5 ""holdovers"", students who for one reason or another, cannot go home and need to stay at the boarding school for the entire Christmas break... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest from director Alexander Payne (""Sideways"", ""The Descendants""). Here he brings to the big screen what life is like in Fall of 1970 among a group of privileged HS students along with their testy classics teacher and a Black woman who runs the kitchen. On the surface of it all, this looks to be a terrible combination, but as the movie plays out, more and more is revealed. The movie is plot-heavy and I shan't say another word on that. Paul Giamatti, a regular of Payne's prior movie work, brings what I feel is one of his strongest movie roles ever. Da'Vine Joy Randolph is outstanding as the Black kitchen supervisor with a heavy heart. Dominic Sessa is frankly too old (33 in real life) to play the rebellious HS student Angus (17 in the movie), I mean, it's really really obvious. That said, Payne just hits all the right notes in this film, and this resonated with me on so many levels. Despite the serious undertones, there are quite a few funny moments in the movie as well.""The Holdovers"" premiered a few months ago at the Telluride film festival to immediate and widespread critical acclaim. There is good reason why this is currently rated 87% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. The movie opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati the weekend before last. The early Sunday evening screening where I saw this at was attended so-so (about 12-15 people). If you are in the mood for a top-notch comedy drama, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion."
"The Holdovers","imseeg","14 December 2023",610,"I am big fan of director Alexander Payne (The Descendants, Sideways) and of actor Paul Giamatti in particular. Both have teamed up before with marvellous results, but this movie has got 1 problem that made me only rate it with 6 stars though:The bad:the middle part of this story stretches out too long, with several quite tedious scenes, which could have easily been cut out of it without hurting the storyline. I started watching at my watch half way through several times because of this lack of spark and punch. Such a pity!Fortunately this movie picked up momentum again towards the warmhearted Christmas spirited final, but I still will only award this movie with 6 stars (instead of 7) because I got bored at many moments during the somewhat tedious and long middle part.The story: It's about a young student and his teacher, who both are lonely souls and although they cant stand each other at first, eventually slowly do bond with each other during a Christmas holiday. Acting by Paul Giamatti is masterful (as always), BUT some of the other actors fail to impress me.Not the best of director Alexander Payne's work, but definitely still worth a watch, because it left me in my seat with a smile on my face and a feel good Christmas spirit of caring for one another!"
"The Holdovers","cparousis-30615","1 January 2024",1010,"Sad, poignant, funny, and beautiful are words that best describe this film. If this film doesn't make you feel sone kind of emotion, you are absolutely heartless. You love these characters. You feel for them on every single level. The film itself feels like a film from the 70s. The twists and turns the film takes are wonderful and heartwarming/heartbreaking. Paul Giamatti is excellent as always. This is Dominic Sessa's first film and he does an outstanding job. No crazy special effects or bloated explosions. Just great filmmaking. It's streaming on Peacock. An absolute holiday must. Take the time to watch it. You'll love it."
"The Holdovers","arfdawg-1","26 December 2023",510,"Lots of great reviews here. Many people who have seen Sideways seem to be excited that Giamatti has re-teamed with Payne the director.Of course, the film is in no way related to the other movie, except that both were involved and that Sideways has quite a cult following.Unfortunately this is not my type of movie. I'm not saying it's bad. And I'm not saying anything bad about the people who seem to love it. It's just not for me.It's a character driven movie, which is fine, except I didnt bond with any of the characters. And I found the choice of musical tunes throughout to be annoying at best.So if you like drawn out period piece character driven flicks, you may like this one. I didn't love it, but I could see how some might, hence the ""5"" rating."
"The Holdovers","kevin_robbins","31 December 2023",910,"My wife and I watched The Holdovers (2023) on Peacock last night. The storyline unfolds at a boarding school in Massachusetts during holiday vacation, focusing on the kids with nowhere to go for the holidays and the staff assigned to care for them, who happen to be facing a similar issue. Together, they work to uncover inner demons and find a way to release them, allowing everyone to truly enjoy the holiday season.Directed by Alexander Payne (Sideways), the film stars Paul Giamatti (American Splendor), Da'Vine Joy Randolph (Dolemite is my Name), Dominic Sessa, and Carrie Preston (Claws).This is an exceptionally unique holiday film, offering intriguing settings, characters, and circumstances. All facets are fascinating and worthwhile, with outstanding writing that establishes the storyline and various subplots effectively. The dialogue is absolutely superb, featuring a well-balanced blend of raw emotion, character development, and comedy. The eyebrow-raising conclusion is perfect for the characters' concluding direction.In conclusion, The Holdovers is a unique and captivating character piece that's an absolute must-see. I would score this a 9/10 and strongly recommend it."
"The Holdovers","euroGary","19 October 2023",1010,"One does not expect a Christmas film to be challenging, and this one certainly isn't. But it is a lot of fun.A boys' boarding school empties of almost all staff and pupils for the 1970/1 Festive Season. Left behind are Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti), the unpopular history teacher who has to keep an eye on the school; Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa), a teenaged pupil whose mother does not want him on her honeymoon; and Mary Lamb (the impressively-named Da'Vine Joy Randolph), the school cook who is facing her first Christmas alone since her son died on military service. As these three lonely souls come together, there are tantrums, emotional revelations, the revealing of long-hidden secrets, a noble sacrifice... the usual stuff.Also the usual stuff are the characters: Paul is cynical and frustrated; Angus is ironic and insecure; and as Mary is overweight and black, she of course has to be sassy.But while in some films such predictability would be annoying, it works here. Within the limits of their somewhat two-dimensional personalities, the characters are well-written - even Angus' tantrums do not seem unreasonable. Plus, there are some great gags (""You hit him? You mean you punched him out?"" ""No, I hit him with a car..."") And I will not be the only viewer who finishes the film with a lump in his throat.Great fun. I can easily see myself buying the DVD and watching this for many Christmases to come..."
"The Holdovers","cherold","31 December 2023",810,"This movie is about a handful of entitled boys who regretfully must stay behind during the Christmas break at their private school and the teacher and cook there to oversee them.It's a funny and affecting movie with excellent performances from the leads, especially Paul giamatti as the prickly teacher.It's a Christmas movie of sorts, since it does take place at Christmas, but it's really more of an anytime of the year film in which you get to see people have adventures and fight and grow and that sort of thing.It's very well filmed, it's very entertaining, and I would recommend you watch it."
"The Holdovers","bastille-852-731547","29 October 2023",610,"Set in December 1970, ""The Holdovers"" follows a small group of students who have to stay on campus over the Christmas break at Barton Academy (a prestigious boarding school in Massachusetts,) alongside a curmudgeonly ancient history teacher (Paul Giamatti.) That sounds like a potentially amusing premise for a breezy comedy-drama, especially when Alexander Payne is directing. Having greatly enjoyed and admired several of Payne's previous films such as ""Sideways,"" ""The Descendants,"" and ""Nebraska,"" I was looking forward to this film. Overall, I found it to be simply fine and not up to par with the level of quality of most of Payne's films. There's nothing too wrong with it by any stretch of the imagination, but it's often generic and forgettable compared to Payne's other films.An indie dramedy like this film would generally be expected to be defined by being character- and writing-driven. Unfortunately, neither the characters nor the writing here are especially unique enough to structure a compelling plot around. Paul (Giamatti's character) is very generic, as is the rebellious student Angus, whose relationship with Paul is a pivotal part of the film. On a better note, Da'Vine Joy Randolph gives a strong and impactful performance as Mary, a cafeteria worker dealing with bereavement; her character is interestingly more dynamic and multi-dimensional than either Paul or Angus. The writing and humor is less unique, funny, or engaging than many of Payne's films, as the attempts at plot devices, character development, and humor often boil down to insult comedy between Paul and Angus--which, ultimately, wears out its welcome a bit, and actually causes a bit of collateral damage in making the film's tone and story feel less sincere. Regardless of the sincerity of the story, another thing that is clear here is that there needed to be a stronger and less predictable core to the plot in order for the film to remain engaging for its 133-minute runtime.The film's retro, 1970s-aesthetic is commendable and helps contribute to the atmosphere of the film, and there still are some sporadic sweet moments of Paul and Mary hanging out around the television and a few decent jokes here and there. So ""The Holdovers"" is a fine enough film, but it won't be a new holiday classic for me. 6/10."
"The Holdovers","RahulM007","31 October 2023",1010,"""Penis cancer in human form.""Alexander Payne's ""The Holdovers"" is a laugh-out-loud comedy strengthened by Paul Giamatti and Dominic Sessa's magnetic performances and their incredible chemistry together. I am in awe by the film's brilliant and inventive screenplay, 70s-style cinematography, slick editing, and great production design. I could watch Paul and Angus bicker for another two hours. Throughout the film, the humour gets more interwoven leading to a crescendo of hilarity. ""The Holdovers"" offers the perfect blend of humor and pathos.*That waitress was so rude for refusing to accept their order of cherries jubilee. She is a fascist and a ""penis cancer in human form"".*The film reminded me of Peter Weir's ""Dead Poets Society"", Milos Forman's ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", and John Hughes' ""The Breakfast Club"" (kind of).Final verdict: 10/10."
"The Holdovers","Avwillfan89","29 November 2023",910,"Finally, Alexander Payne has made a worthy follow up to his (in my opinion at least) masterpiece Sideways.I really related so much to all three of the main characters, who all come from different backgrounds. Paul Giamatti, brilliant in almost anything he does, plays a grumpy, alcoholic, sour professor who does not suffer fools and doesn't cut his privileged students any slack. Dominic Sessa is troubled teen with a dysfunctional family and mental issues. D'Avine Joy Randolf is a grieving mother stuck in a job wanting to make ends meet for her family, by her choice.This movie has great character development, a wholesome story with flawed yet lovable characters you can root for and terrific, funny dialogue. Simple, yet perfect. 9 out of 10."
"The Holdovers","frankde-jong","27 December 2023",910,"I had a lot of associations when I started watching ""The holdovers"".Kids stuck in a school during the Christmas vacation, is that not a little bit like ""The breakfast club"" (1985, John Hughes)? No, because most of the kids go away early in the film and we are left with just one pupil (Angus Tully played by Dominic Sessa) and a teacher (Paul Hunham played by Paul Giamatti).Paul Hunham teaches ancient languages and culture. Does that sounds like the Donna Tartt novel ""The secret history"" (1992)? No, in that novel the pupils are inspired by their teacher. In ""The holdovers"" the teacher is hated.One association that I did not have at all prior to watching the movie may be the most accurate: ""Scent of a woman"" (1992, Martin Brest). Also in this film a high school pupil on an expensive boarding school and a grumpy old man are condemned to each other.Best of all however we can see ""The holdovers"" as the comeback of Alexander Payne after his failed film ""Downsizing"" (2017). The film is situated in 1970 and has a very 70's look and feel, down to the aspect ratio then used. The film also contains very beautiful images of Norteast American landscapes.First of all however the film is about its three main characters. Apart from the two already introduced we have the chief cook of the boarding school Mary Lamb (Da'Vine Joy Randolph). These three people form a sort of substitute family that has to spend the Christmas season together. Each of them has his/her problems but during the film they grow closer to each other, or at least learn to understand each other better.Being a Christmas movie you expect a happy ending and somewhere in the middle of the film this happy ending seems to consist of all the members of the proxy family being on their way towards an unexpected romance. The greatness of the film is that these romances do not materialize fully. The message of the film seems to be that gaining better understanding is a happy enough ending.By the way the film does not shy away from some social criticism. The character of Paul Hunham is meant to be grumpy at first, but to me he was instantly sympathetic when he made the headmaster of the boarding school very clear that in his class wealthy parents could not buy good grades for their sons. Later he says to his pupils (at that stage of the film there are still a couple of them) that they ought to be aware of their privileged status. ""You go to Harvard, poorer boys go to Vietnam"". The Vietnam war plays an important role in the background anyway. The son of the chief cook has died in Vietnam and while visiting a bar in the village nearby the boarding school there is a local boy that lost one of his hands in Vietnam.All in all ""The holdovers"" is a very convincing comeback of Alexander Payne. He made an instant Christmas classic!"
"The Holdovers","210west","14 January 2024",410,"Alexander Payne's 1999 comedy ""Election,"" set in a Midwestern high school, was brilliant, sometimes painful, sometimes hilarious. Best of all (I say this as a onetime high school teacher), it felt refreshingly authentic.""The Holdovers"" is quite the opposite: contrived, predictable, and intended to teach -- you guessed it -- a little lesson in compassion. An hour into it, I realized that it hadn't yet contained a single moment that seemed genuine, much less surprising. Every line of dialogue sounds phony. Characters speak in little announcements, spelling things out for us. Some of the characters -- a couple of menacing townies, for example -- are mere cartoons.Giamatti's protagonist is a wholly artificial creation, designed as if in a screenwriting course to follow the approved character arc -- initially stuffy and unsympathetic to the point of caricature, ultimately vulnerable. Ironically, an early scene between him and the school's headmaster violates what's sometimes regarded as a screenwriting rule: Do NOT, even in the interest of exposition, have people telling each other what they already know. (The by-the-numbers triteness of that conversation -- meant to show us that the instructor is uncompromising and pedantic but possesses old-fashioned integrity, blah blah blah -- put me off from the start.) The scenes between Giamatti and the school's cook -- in which, with the audience in mind, the two provide personal backstories and reveal their inner selves -- are painfully heavy-handed and at times so gooey that I felt sorry for the actress: ""You can't even dream a whole dream, can you?"" she is made to say at one point. ""What are you afraid of?""Yes, I know, everybody seems to love the movie. I could barely stomach it. But do check out ""Election."""
"The Holdovers","bdesdes","30 October 2023",810,"Very enjoyable film with outstanding performances and a wonderful warm vibe accompanied by the Christmas season. It's funny at times, sad at times, and feel-good. It's a story that almost all can relate to and will really touch your heart. It deals with so many themes, but mainly grief, the past, family, and what makes a person who they are. It's also very original and has a great script, cinematography, and soundtrack. I would highly advise to see it in the theaters as well as you really get the 70's vibe and deep moment on the big screen. There aren't many negatives to this film and I would recommend it to most people."
"The Holdovers","aharmas","29 October 2023",1010,"Here is a film that feels and looks like something out of the early seventies. The Holdovers is a strong and warm-hearted piece that gives actors roles with powerful lines, without any reliance on flashy editing and being overwhelmed by special effects.The story is simple three people get stuck for the Christmas holidays in a boarding school. It's cold, lonely, and boring for the parties involved. The adults drink to cope with whatever pressures they live with. The young man resorts to bad behavior and altercations with the teacher in charge.Through the vacation period these people will get to interact and get to know each other, something that will prove to a challenge to say the least. As the story evolves, we get to understand what has made the people who they are. We get to feel their pain and frustration through the very insightful writing of the director.It's a strong film with superb acting by the main leads. They have great chemistry together.Most outstanding is Paul Giamatti who plays the tormented and defensive man with relish and speaks volumes with his eyes.Hope the academy honors his performance as the best the year because no one else so far is coming close."
"The Holdovers","darkreignn","29 October 2023",910,"Let's just get this out of the way now - when it comes to writing this review, I'm probably a little bit biased (and a little bit drunk, currently, but that's besides the point). You see, I have an affinity for indie coming of age movies, and ""The Holdovers"" is basically an indie coming of age film, so it may - or may not - come as a surprise to you that I absolutely adored this picture. So, with that little preface out of the way, it's time for me to gush over this movie.Starring none other than Paul Giamatti as Paul Hunham, Giamatti plays a professor at an all boys boarding school where, over Christmas break, he has the misfortune of looking over a group of boys, one of whom is named Angus, played by Dominic Sessa. After a rocky start, where Paul clearly doesn't get along with any of the boys, making his disdain clear and evident, he eventually finds himself alone with Angus - as well as with the school's cook, Mary Lamb, played by Da'Vine Joy Randolph - in an unexpected chain of events. What occurs after is a slice-of-life style piece of cinema that allows broken people to find comfort in each other's company.""The Holdovers"" is, without a doubt, one of my favorite movies of 2023, as well as probably one of the best movies of the year, as well. This Christmas-themed gem doesn't hold back on the drama, delivering a thoughtful blend of comedy, coming-of-age storytelling, and a touch of romance - all wrapped around a very raw, human plot-line that virtually everyone can relate to. I'm no spring chicken myself, but I found myself deeply connected to both main characters - one who is older and basically dejected with life as he knows it, and one who is younger but who feels lost, aimless, and disconnected from both family and friends. And admittedly, not everyone will have a direct parallel to these experiences, but even if you don't, you're in for a story that's bound to tug at your heartstrings... and make you laugh out loud in the process.This is a high-quality movie - from the impeccable acting to the beautiful on-location cinematography to the relatable, thought-provoking plot, every element is executed with pinpoint precision and finesse; it's a testament to the art of storytelling on the silver screen. Director Alexander Payne knows how to create an artful film, and ""The Holdovers"" is no exception. It's at once indie and art-house while simultaneously being mainstream and easily accessible; in short, it's a film for everyone that actually feels like a genuine crowdpleaser instead of a pandering mess.I'm having a difficult time describing what I liked about this movie, and the reason is because I liked almost everything about this movie. So why the 9 out of 10 rating instead of the perfect 10? Literally the only thing that's holding me back is because I would've liked a touch more romance; yes, there was romance here, but a bit more would've pushed me over the edge into 10 out of 10 territory. Besides that, this is basically a perfect film, one that I loved, and one that has become one of my favorite movies of the year, if not of all time. I am genuinely looking forward to rewatching this, and I can't wait until it becomes closer to Christmas so I can view this on my own TV, cuddled under blankets, with a glass of whiskey, and bask in the absolute heartwarming experience that is ""The Holdovers."" My recommendation: Do yourself a favor and watch this as soon as you can - you won't regret it."
"The Holdovers","evanston_dad","20 November 2023",1010,"Mid-way through ""The Holdovers,"" I started openly weeping in the movie theater, and I pretty much kept it up on and off for the rest of the movie. Sometimes, there wasn't even anything obviously sad or moving happening in the scene, and I still couldn't stop. I think it's because this movie is so kind, and kindness is a rare commodity these days. It's sad to think that a movie about characters learning to have compassion for each other and for the hardships they've been through should feel like such a rare beast, but here we are.This is Alexander Payne firing on all cylinders as a director, and though he didn't write this movie, it feels like he could have. It's an obvious throwback to the kinds of movies Hal Ashby made throughout the 1970s and is touching in exactly the same way ""Harold and Maude"" was. It's also a master class in acting from the three principal characters played by Paul Giamatti, Dominic Sessa, and Da 'Vine Joy Randolph, and I hope all three of them, and the movie overall, is remembered come Oscar time.This will easily make my top ten list for the year.Grade: A+"
"The Holdovers","Xstal","28 November 2023",810,"Now here's a film with a life affirming theme, that should encourage most viewers to think of their dreams, and cascade away all their cloaks, inhibitions, and open fresh doors to their heart's intuitions; as a teacher whose life is as stale as dead fish, whose life is the opposite of happy and bliss, meets a boy who's ignored by all those he holds dear, and a friendship is formed that is warm and sincere; it's a subtle reflection of how we get trapped, by tradition and habits and past circumstance, where surroundings like prisons can temper our thinking, to distil all our spirit, to bottles for drinking; so embrace all the chances when they come along, break out of that mould and sing your own song, open your eyes to the paths unexplored, take a stand and stand tall, and stop being ignored."
"The Holdovers","steiner-sam","10 November 2023",910,"It's a comedy-drama set from December 16, 1970, to the first week of January 1971 in an exclusive boy's boarding school in New England and Boston, Massachusetts. It follows the experiences of the ""holdovers,"" that is, the students who cannot go home over the Christmas holidays and the two Barton staff left to supervise them during the holidays.There are five holdovers: Teddy Kountze (Brady Hepner), Jason Smith (Michael Provost), and Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa) are upper-class wealthy WASP students. Alex Ollerman (Ian Dolley) is a younger Mormon student whose parents are on a mission in South America. Ye-Joon Park (Jim Kaplan) is from South Korea.Left to supervise is Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti), an unmarried ancient history teacher who was once a student at Barton and has taught there all his career. He's a demanding curmudgeon who almost everyone dislikes. African American Mary Lamb (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), the head cook, is also present; her son, a Barton grad, has just been killed in Vietnam.The film follows the shared experiences of the holdovers, though four students leave after a week when a wealthy father takes them for a ski holiday. Paul cannot contact Angus's parents, so he must stay with Paul and Mary at Barton. We also meet the school's headmaster, Hardy Woodrup (Andrew Garman), his administrative assistant, Lydia Crane (Carrie Preston), and janitor Danny (Naheem Garcia).""The Holdovers"" is a delightful comedy leavened with wisdom as we learn the dark secrets that have shaped Paul Hunham and Angus Tully. Giamatti, Sessa, and Randolph are all excellent. The script unfolds the twists and turns superbly. ""The Holdovers"" is a great Christmas movie."
"The Holdovers","JohnDeSando","16 November 2023",NA,"""I find the world a bitter and complicated place. And it seems to feel the same way about me."" Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti)Teaching privileged boys at an elite new England prep school called Barton (think for example, Philips Exeter), might be the pinnacle of an academic's career. But not Paul Hunham in The Holdovers, an elite movie itself of the year.Paul should be teaching classics at an ivy school, not teaching entitled ""vermin,"" among the many sobriquets he tosses around about the fortunate young men to experience his brand of grumpy intellectualism and misanthropy. He prepares them for a world that won't always be coddling and protecting them as their family wealth so naturally does in their early years.Director Alexander Payne worked with Giamatti in Sideways, so he is prepared to have another winning cynical character who is endearing while distanced by negative temperament from normally positive fellow humans (Paul's last name, Hunham, suggests a distant connection with the better angels of humanity).As Paul accepts the assignment to supervise holdovers (exiled to Christmas vacation in the absence of parents or guardians), the number whittles down to just Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa, reminiscent of young, Timothy Chalamet and Adam Driver), who shares Paul's dark attitudes and, with the sharp writing of David Hemingson, some witty dialogue- e.g., about Paul he says, ""I thought all of the Nazis had left for Argentina.""Although, as in likeminded dramas such as Dead Poet's Society or Goodbye, Mr. Chips, the principals are destined to be transformed into more humane characters, Holdovers continues, even in its denouement, to accentuate the unsunny side of life for Paul and Tully, whose fortunes are still compromised by cold-hearted parents and administrators. The chilly world, however, is warmed on these lovely, snowbound days, by women, viz., the cook, Mary (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) and administrator Lydia (Carrie Preston).Mary good-naturedly deals with the death of her son, Curtis, a Barton grad who had to join the military because he did not have the resources as other Barton grads of the late '60s did to avoid the draft.Lydia, an attractive middle-aged staff member, holds the promise of a love interest for Paul, only to show how difficult it is for social exiles to enter the romantic mainstream.The Holdovers is a small gem of a move that will immediately remind buffs about Hal Ashby comedies of the same era like Harold & Maude, where character development is paramount and detachment from the mainstream is required to look at humanity clearly with its foibles and endearments.The Holdovers is a movie everyone can enjoy with endearing characters who share with us our moments about loneliness peppered with the possibilities of love and happiness.""Do you think I want to be babysitting you? No. I was praying your mother would pick up the phone, or your father would arrive in a helicopter or a flying saucer...."" Paul Hunham."
"The Holdovers","dtswpod","6 November 2023",810,"Do you miss how they used to make films in the 1970s? Plenty of filmmakers do, except they take that nostalgia and just do watered down versions of better movies. As an example see Taxi Driver and King of Comedy then watch Joker and you'll get what I mean.Thankfully, Alexander Payne has managed to take his sentimentality and make an original film out of it. Or if The Holdovers is a pale imitation of a superior picture then the filmmaker has managed to trick me because I don't feel as if I've seen this movie before but done better.Now to be clear, there aren't things you've never seen before in the movie. I mean, you know the characters are going to bond at some point. And people will grow to care about each other. That's a given. How we get there, however, is what makes the film seem fresh and entertaining and ever bit as good as any flick made back in the day.I hope more people see it."
"The Holdovers","tdwillis-26273","7 December 2023",810,"Finally......a GOOD movie. The story/script, although not a breakthrough idea, was heartfelt,full and real.The settings were also real and gorgeous (not really a cgi fan)
Camera, cinematography, lighting,sound,score....every level made my eyes and ears satisfyingly full.Acting was oscarworthy across the board.Directing was brilliant.Only negative I can come up with is that the pace was a bit slow, but so much of the movie is so focused and so superbly and beautifully made I just sat back and enjoyed it.A very thoughtful substantial and beautiful movie. A rare gem in today's superficial gimmicky movie making world."
"The Holdovers","ferguson-6","8 November 2023",810,"Greetings again from the darkness. We've all had that teacher. You know, the one with an evil streak who just seemed to thrive on making students miserable. Throw in a staff and administrators who feel the same way, and the casting choice for the teacher becomes obvious. Enter the always great and perfectly curmudgeonly Paul Giamatti. This is the first time Giamatti has worked with two-time Oscar winner Alexander Payne since their brilliant SIDEWAYS (2004), and it's clear these two share a wavelength for comedy and drama, even in throwback form.Paul Hunham (Giamatti) is a long-time professor at Barton Academy, an all-boys private prep school located in the snowy northeast. It's December 1970, and an early scene exemplifies how he relishes the failing grades he bestows upon desperate students so afraid to disappoint their rich parents. In the final class before the holiday break, the student-teacher banter doesn't go so well for the boys, and they head to break with an extra workload. Hunham is easily manipulated into babysitting the titular holdovers - students stuck at school over the break, while most others spend time with family, often on exotic trips.Initially there are five students, but after a certain development, what remains is Hunham, smart but troubled Angus Tully (first timer Dominic Sessa) and the school's head cook, Mary Lamb (a divine Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019). Hunham is perpetually annoyed and has a weakness for booze. Angus is frustrated that his mother left him at school so she could travel with her new husband, and Mary is grieving over her son who was killed in Vietnam. Watching these three struggle to bond is a case study in psychology, yet of course we know they will ultimately form a family of misfits, depending on each other to offset the loneliness.The genius tagline for the film is ""Discomfort and Joy"", and initially the first overshadows the latter. Isolated from the world in their own way, the three characters begin to influence each other, showing broken/wounded people need and deserve love and friendship as much as anyone else. ""Entre nous"" (just between us) becomes a kind of calling card for this trio, and a Christmas party thrown by an eternally optimistic staffer (Carrie Preston) is a turning point.Giamatti is master of this material and only goes over the top a time or two. It's painful and humorous each time he is so anxious to infuse his breadth of ancient civilization facts into even the most mundane conversations. Newcomer Sessa possesses star potential and nails a complex first role. Da'Vine Joy Randolph's Mary is the heart of the film, doling out advice to Hunham and comfort to Angus. Depression is a vein running through these characters and it's acknowledged, though not the focus.This is Alexander Payne's first film since the disappointing DOWNSIZING (2017), but his brilliance has been proven in ABOUT SCHMIDT (2002), SIDEWAYS (2004), THE DESCENDANTS (2011), and NEBRASKA (2013). This time he's working from a screenplay by successful TV writer, David Hemingson, and though there is never much suspense about where the story or characters are headed, we enjoy the ride immensely. Cinematography from Eigil Byrld (IN BRUGES, 2008), perfectly complements the emotions (shot on digital, graininess added in post), and the soundtrack is period-specific, including the great Cat Stevens. Pay attention to the retro opening credits and logos, and enjoy a smart and funny film (an Alexander Payne trademark).Opening in theaters November 10, 2023."
"The Holdovers","akcenat","1 January 2024",810,"""The Holdovers"" is a captivating blend of comedy and drama that beautifully explores the complexities of human relationships.Story is about a grumpy instructor (Paul Giamatti) at a New England prep school who forms an unexpected bond with a troubled student during the Christmas break. Because it is set in the 1970s, the film in a way is a nostalgic journey back in time, but with a narrative that is both engaging and thought-provoking.The performances are exceptional, with Giamatti delivering a compelling portrayal of a man grappling with his own loneliness and the challenges of mentorship. The film's narrative is richly layered, exploring themes of loneliness, friendship, and personal growth. It's a story that resonates, offering a poignant reflection on the human condition. The film's setting in the 1970s adds a layer of nostalgia, further enhancing the emotional depth of the narrative. Despite its lengthy runtime, ""The Holdovers"" mostly maintains a steady pace, balancing its dramatic elements with moments of humor and warmth. The main plus of the movie is its dialogue-driven approach that adds to its charm, creating a sense of authenticity and depth in its character interactions.Overall, this is a film that leaves a lasting impression, offering a thoughtful exploration of human relationships set against the backdrop of a bygone era. With its exceptional performances and engaging narrative, I'm giving it an 8 out of 10 rating. It's a must-watch for those seeking a film that combines drama, comedy, and a touch of nostalgia."
"The Holdovers","Quinoa1984","30 October 2023",1010,"The Holdovers is, for all of the character dynamics and dysfunction and depression and other things we find out about the leads, mostly with Mr. Hunham and Angus and how their characters over these couple of weeks turn away from the ""Barton"" way of not telling lies (because, well, sometimes context and the moment matter for telling a lie that won't really hurt, maybe), a strangely comforting film to watch. Not for all of that exactly, though what we understand slowly but surely is this is all material for comedy and tragedy in equal measure, but because of the feeling that we get with a filmmaker who is so primed and confident with material that you don't feel like it can go wrong.What is more impressive is that, as enjoyable as the first half is, it is in the ""I like this"" mode as we are introduced to this world and Hunham and Angus and Mary, but it doesn't feel so special. But I should have known Payne and writer David Hemingson were laying down the necessary groundwork for what comes the moment a) the majority of the other supporting characters leave for reasons I don't have to mention here, and b) then the characters go outside the Barton campus grounds on a holiday party and then a ""field trip"" to Boston, you get the sense moment by moment and interaction by interaction it is so sharp and cutting and wise, and one scene in particular makes the jump into ""oh, OK, this is taking off into another level of personal pain and about familial expectations and what will come with in a life measuring up to others - and why that is wrong - and... yeah, it's great"" territory.In other words, it's the kind of film I want to watch again right away simply because now that I know a little more about the characters, I'll want to experience all of the extra textures (its 1970 down to the wood paneling and the car seats), and dig a little more into those absolutely wonderful natural restrained and complete performances - we take Giamatti for granted sometimes and this is a character he should be proud of to craft, lazy-ass eyes and all; Sessa's first role and he is an immediate star; I can't be more sure of anything for the next Oscar's that, if Randolph is nominated, she will win, if nothing else for everything she does at the Christmas party scenes, and a moment looking over some objects in a room later on is so moving - and my comfort is in seeing Payne clearly loving directing this intimate character study where he can show what a comedically observant, quick witted, and heartbreaking story this all is.It's one of the best Christmas movies in several years, embodying many themes and ideals that fit like a 70s wool sweater, and I'm sure the first thing Payne must have thought after reading the script was ""whoa. This is gonna be the best Hal Ashby or Bob Rafelson movie never made... is 'The Last Holdover' too on the nose?"" Even Hunham would give this... a B+ probably (did he ever give As? Shrug)."
"The Holdovers","jjgonzalez-06426","31 October 2023",910,"Quite possibly one of the best Christmas films ever? I first saw Payne & Giamatti's previous film together, ""Sideways"" during my screenwriting training class, and it is one that I would think of for a while. Their new film, ""The Holdovers"", is hilarious, beautifully shot and acted, heartwarming, and has a great sense of grief and joy meshed together. Definitely leaning towards Randolph for Best Supporting Actress; her performance BLEW me away.Overall, I love these films. Light-hearted & comedic while also have a sense of darkness and a lot of heavy emotion to it. Definitely is one of the most heartfelt films of the year."
"The Holdovers","paul-allaer","20 November 2023",810,"As ""The Holdovers"" (2023 release; 133 min.) opens, it's 1970 and we are at the Barton HS boarding school in New England as the Fall semester wraps up. Paul Hunham, a teacher of classical studies and a curmudgeon, gets summoned by the head of school, and is told he will take charge of the 4 or 5 ""holdovers"", students who for one reason or another, cannot go home and need to stay at the boarding school for the entire Christmas break... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest from director Alexander Payne (""Sideways"", ""The Descendants""). Here he brings to the big screen what life is like in Fall of 1970 among a group of privileged HS students along with their testy classics teacher and a Black woman who runs the kitchen. On the surface of it all, this looks to be a terrible combination, but as the movie plays out, more and more is revealed. The movie is plot-heavy and I shan't say another word on that. Paul Giamatti, a regular of Payne's prior movie work, brings what I feel is one of his strongest movie roles ever. Da'Vine Joy Randolph is outstanding as the Black kitchen supervisor with a heavy heart. Dominic Sessa is frankly too old (33 in real life) to play the rebellious HS student Angus (17 in the movie), I mean, it's really really obvious. That said, Payne just hits all the right notes in this film, and this resonated with me on so many levels. Despite the serious undertones, there are quite a few funny moments in the movie as well.""The Holdovers"" premiered a few months ago at the Telluride film festival to immediate and widespread critical acclaim. There is good reason why this is currently rated 87% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. The movie opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati the weekend before last. The early Sunday evening screening where I saw this at was attended so-so (about 12-15 people). If you are in the mood for a top-notch comedy drama, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion."
"The Holdovers","imseeg","14 December 2023",610,"I am big fan of director Alexander Payne (The Descendants, Sideways) and of actor Paul Giamatti in particular. Both have teamed up before with marvellous results, but this movie has got 1 problem that made me only rate it with 6 stars though:The bad:the middle part of this story stretches out too long, with several quite tedious scenes, which could have easily been cut out of it without hurting the storyline. I started watching at my watch half way through several times because of this lack of spark and punch. Such a pity!Fortunately this movie picked up momentum again towards the warmhearted Christmas spirited final, but I still will only award this movie with 6 stars (instead of 7) because I got bored at many moments during the somewhat tedious and long middle part.The story: It's about a young student and his teacher, who both are lonely souls and although they cant stand each other at first, eventually slowly do bond with each other during a Christmas holiday. Acting by Paul Giamatti is masterful (as always), BUT some of the other actors fail to impress me.Not the best of director Alexander Payne's work, but definitely still worth a watch, because it left me in my seat with a smile on my face and a feel good Christmas spirit of caring for one another!"
"The Holdovers","cparousis-30615","1 January 2024",1010,"Sad, poignant, funny, and beautiful are words that best describe this film. If this film doesn't make you feel sone kind of emotion, you are absolutely heartless. You love these characters. You feel for them on every single level. The film itself feels like a film from the 70s. The twists and turns the film takes are wonderful and heartwarming/heartbreaking. Paul Giamatti is excellent as always. This is Dominic Sessa's first film and he does an outstanding job. No crazy special effects or bloated explosions. Just great filmmaking. It's streaming on Peacock. An absolute holiday must. Take the time to watch it. You'll love it."
"The Holdovers","arfdawg-1","26 December 2023",510,"Lots of great reviews here. Many people who have seen Sideways seem to be excited that Giamatti has re-teamed with Payne the director.Of course, the film is in no way related to the other movie, except that both were involved and that Sideways has quite a cult following.Unfortunately this is not my type of movie. I'm not saying it's bad. And I'm not saying anything bad about the people who seem to love it. It's just not for me.It's a character driven movie, which is fine, except I didnt bond with any of the characters. And I found the choice of musical tunes throughout to be annoying at best.So if you like drawn out period piece character driven flicks, you may like this one. I didn't love it, but I could see how some might, hence the ""5"" rating."
"The Holdovers","kevin_robbins","31 December 2023",910,"My wife and I watched The Holdovers (2023) on Peacock last night. The storyline unfolds at a boarding school in Massachusetts during holiday vacation, focusing on the kids with nowhere to go for the holidays and the staff assigned to care for them, who happen to be facing a similar issue. Together, they work to uncover inner demons and find a way to release them, allowing everyone to truly enjoy the holiday season.Directed by Alexander Payne (Sideways), the film stars Paul Giamatti (American Splendor), Da'Vine Joy Randolph (Dolemite is my Name), Dominic Sessa, and Carrie Preston (Claws).This is an exceptionally unique holiday film, offering intriguing settings, characters, and circumstances. All facets are fascinating and worthwhile, with outstanding writing that establishes the storyline and various subplots effectively. The dialogue is absolutely superb, featuring a well-balanced blend of raw emotion, character development, and comedy. The eyebrow-raising conclusion is perfect for the characters' concluding direction.In conclusion, The Holdovers is a unique and captivating character piece that's an absolute must-see. I would score this a 9/10 and strongly recommend it."
"The Holdovers","euroGary","19 October 2023",1010,"One does not expect a Christmas film to be challenging, and this one certainly isn't. But it is a lot of fun.A boys' boarding school empties of almost all staff and pupils for the 1970/1 Festive Season. Left behind are Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti), the unpopular history teacher who has to keep an eye on the school; Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa), a teenaged pupil whose mother does not want him on her honeymoon; and Mary Lamb (the impressively-named Da'Vine Joy Randolph), the school cook who is facing her first Christmas alone since her son died on military service. As these three lonely souls come together, there are tantrums, emotional revelations, the revealing of long-hidden secrets, a noble sacrifice... the usual stuff.Also the usual stuff are the characters: Paul is cynical and frustrated; Angus is ironic and insecure; and as Mary is overweight and black, she of course has to be sassy.But while in some films such predictability would be annoying, it works here. Within the limits of their somewhat two-dimensional personalities, the characters are well-written - even Angus' tantrums do not seem unreasonable. Plus, there are some great gags (""You hit him? You mean you punched him out?"" ""No, I hit him with a car..."") And I will not be the only viewer who finishes the film with a lump in his throat.Great fun. I can easily see myself buying the DVD and watching this for many Christmases to come..."
"The Holdovers","cherold","31 December 2023",810,"This movie is about a handful of entitled boys who regretfully must stay behind during the Christmas break at their private school and the teacher and cook there to oversee them.It's a funny and affecting movie with excellent performances from the leads, especially Paul giamatti as the prickly teacher.It's a Christmas movie of sorts, since it does take place at Christmas, but it's really more of an anytime of the year film in which you get to see people have adventures and fight and grow and that sort of thing.It's very well filmed, it's very entertaining, and I would recommend you watch it."
"The Holdovers","bastille-852-731547","29 October 2023",610,"Set in December 1970, ""The Holdovers"" follows a small group of students who have to stay on campus over the Christmas break at Barton Academy (a prestigious boarding school in Massachusetts,) alongside a curmudgeonly ancient history teacher (Paul Giamatti.) That sounds like a potentially amusing premise for a breezy comedy-drama, especially when Alexander Payne is directing. Having greatly enjoyed and admired several of Payne's previous films such as ""Sideways,"" ""The Descendants,"" and ""Nebraska,"" I was looking forward to this film. Overall, I found it to be simply fine and not up to par with the level of quality of most of Payne's films. There's nothing too wrong with it by any stretch of the imagination, but it's often generic and forgettable compared to Payne's other films.An indie dramedy like this film would generally be expected to be defined by being character- and writing-driven. Unfortunately, neither the characters nor the writing here are especially unique enough to structure a compelling plot around. Paul (Giamatti's character) is very generic, as is the rebellious student Angus, whose relationship with Paul is a pivotal part of the film. On a better note, Da'Vine Joy Randolph gives a strong and impactful performance as Mary, a cafeteria worker dealing with bereavement; her character is interestingly more dynamic and multi-dimensional than either Paul or Angus. The writing and humor is less unique, funny, or engaging than many of Payne's films, as the attempts at plot devices, character development, and humor often boil down to insult comedy between Paul and Angus--which, ultimately, wears out its welcome a bit, and actually causes a bit of collateral damage in making the film's tone and story feel less sincere. Regardless of the sincerity of the story, another thing that is clear here is that there needed to be a stronger and less predictable core to the plot in order for the film to remain engaging for its 133-minute runtime.The film's retro, 1970s-aesthetic is commendable and helps contribute to the atmosphere of the film, and there still are some sporadic sweet moments of Paul and Mary hanging out around the television and a few decent jokes here and there. So ""The Holdovers"" is a fine enough film, but it won't be a new holiday classic for me. 6/10."
"The Holdovers","RahulM007","31 October 2023",1010,"""Penis cancer in human form.""Alexander Payne's ""The Holdovers"" is a laugh-out-loud comedy strengthened by Paul Giamatti and Dominic Sessa's magnetic performances and their incredible chemistry together. I am in awe by the film's brilliant and inventive screenplay, 70s-style cinematography, slick editing, and great production design. I could watch Paul and Angus bicker for another two hours. Throughout the film, the humour gets more interwoven leading to a crescendo of hilarity. ""The Holdovers"" offers the perfect blend of humor and pathos.*That waitress was so rude for refusing to accept their order of cherries jubilee. She is a fascist and a ""penis cancer in human form"".*The film reminded me of Peter Weir's ""Dead Poets Society"", Milos Forman's ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", and John Hughes' ""The Breakfast Club"" (kind of).Final verdict: 10/10."
"The Holdovers","Avwillfan89","29 November 2023",910,"Finally, Alexander Payne has made a worthy follow up to his (in my opinion at least) masterpiece Sideways.I really related so much to all three of the main characters, who all come from different backgrounds. Paul Giamatti, brilliant in almost anything he does, plays a grumpy, alcoholic, sour professor who does not suffer fools and doesn't cut his privileged students any slack. Dominic Sessa is troubled teen with a dysfunctional family and mental issues. D'Avine Joy Randolf is a grieving mother stuck in a job wanting to make ends meet for her family, by her choice.This movie has great character development, a wholesome story with flawed yet lovable characters you can root for and terrific, funny dialogue. Simple, yet perfect. 9 out of 10."
"The Holdovers","frankde-jong","27 December 2023",910,"I had a lot of associations when I started watching ""The holdovers"".Kids stuck in a school during the Christmas vacation, is that not a little bit like ""The breakfast club"" (1985, John Hughes)? No, because most of the kids go away early in the film and we are left with just one pupil (Angus Tully played by Dominic Sessa) and a teacher (Paul Hunham played by Paul Giamatti).Paul Hunham teaches ancient languages and culture. Does that sounds like the Donna Tartt novel ""The secret history"" (1992)? No, in that novel the pupils are inspired by their teacher. In ""The holdovers"" the teacher is hated.One association that I did not have at all prior to watching the movie may be the most accurate: ""Scent of a woman"" (1992, Martin Brest). Also in this film a high school pupil on an expensive boarding school and a grumpy old man are condemned to each other.Best of all however we can see ""The holdovers"" as the comeback of Alexander Payne after his failed film ""Downsizing"" (2017). The film is situated in 1970 and has a very 70's look and feel, down to the aspect ratio then used. The film also contains very beautiful images of Norteast American landscapes.First of all however the film is about its three main characters. Apart from the two already introduced we have the chief cook of the boarding school Mary Lamb (Da'Vine Joy Randolph). These three people form a sort of substitute family that has to spend the Christmas season together. Each of them has his/her problems but during the film they grow closer to each other, or at least learn to understand each other better.Being a Christmas movie you expect a happy ending and somewhere in the middle of the film this happy ending seems to consist of all the members of the proxy family being on their way towards an unexpected romance. The greatness of the film is that these romances do not materialize fully. The message of the film seems to be that gaining better understanding is a happy enough ending.By the way the film does not shy away from some social criticism. The character of Paul Hunham is meant to be grumpy at first, but to me he was instantly sympathetic when he made the headmaster of the boarding school very clear that in his class wealthy parents could not buy good grades for their sons. Later he says to his pupils (at that stage of the film there are still a couple of them) that they ought to be aware of their privileged status. ""You go to Harvard, poorer boys go to Vietnam"". The Vietnam war plays an important role in the background anyway. The son of the chief cook has died in Vietnam and while visiting a bar in the village nearby the boarding school there is a local boy that lost one of his hands in Vietnam.All in all ""The holdovers"" is a very convincing comeback of Alexander Payne. He made an instant Christmas classic!"
"The Holdovers","210west","14 January 2024",410,"Alexander Payne's 1999 comedy ""Election,"" set in a Midwestern high school, was brilliant, sometimes painful, sometimes hilarious. Best of all (I say this as a onetime high school teacher), it felt refreshingly authentic.""The Holdovers"" is quite the opposite: contrived, predictable, and intended to teach -- you guessed it -- a little lesson in compassion. An hour into it, I realized that it hadn't yet contained a single moment that seemed genuine, much less surprising. Every line of dialogue sounds phony. Characters speak in little announcements, spelling things out for us. Some of the characters -- a couple of menacing townies, for example -- are mere cartoons.Giamatti's protagonist is a wholly artificial creation, designed as if in a screenwriting course to follow the approved character arc -- initially stuffy and unsympathetic to the point of caricature, ultimately vulnerable. Ironically, an early scene between him and the school's headmaster violates what's sometimes regarded as a screenwriting rule: Do NOT, even in the interest of exposition, have people telling each other what they already know. (The by-the-numbers triteness of that conversation -- meant to show us that the instructor is uncompromising and pedantic but possesses old-fashioned integrity, blah blah blah -- put me off from the start.) The scenes between Giamatti and the school's cook -- in which, with the audience in mind, the two provide personal backstories and reveal their inner selves -- are painfully heavy-handed and at times so gooey that I felt sorry for the actress: ""You can't even dream a whole dream, can you?"" she is made to say at one point. ""What are you afraid of?""Yes, I know, everybody seems to love the movie. I could barely stomach it. But do check out ""Election."""
"The Holdovers","bdesdes","30 October 2023",810,"Very enjoyable film with outstanding performances and a wonderful warm vibe accompanied by the Christmas season. It's funny at times, sad at times, and feel-good. It's a story that almost all can relate to and will really touch your heart. It deals with so many themes, but mainly grief, the past, family, and what makes a person who they are. It's also very original and has a great script, cinematography, and soundtrack. I would highly advise to see it in the theaters as well as you really get the 70's vibe and deep moment on the big screen. There aren't many negatives to this film and I would recommend it to most people."
"The Holdovers","aharmas","29 October 2023",1010,"Here is a film that feels and looks like something out of the early seventies. The Holdovers is a strong and warm-hearted piece that gives actors roles with powerful lines, without any reliance on flashy editing and being overwhelmed by special effects.The story is simple three people get stuck for the Christmas holidays in a boarding school. It's cold, lonely, and boring for the parties involved. The adults drink to cope with whatever pressures they live with. The young man resorts to bad behavior and altercations with the teacher in charge.Through the vacation period these people will get to interact and get to know each other, something that will prove to a challenge to say the least. As the story evolves, we get to understand what has made the people who they are. We get to feel their pain and frustration through the very insightful writing of the director.It's a strong film with superb acting by the main leads. They have great chemistry together.Most outstanding is Paul Giamatti who plays the tormented and defensive man with relish and speaks volumes with his eyes.Hope the academy honors his performance as the best the year because no one else so far is coming close."
"The Holdovers","darkreignn","29 October 2023",910,"Let's just get this out of the way now - when it comes to writing this review, I'm probably a little bit biased (and a little bit drunk, currently, but that's besides the point). You see, I have an affinity for indie coming of age movies, and ""The Holdovers"" is basically an indie coming of age film, so it may - or may not - come as a surprise to you that I absolutely adored this picture. So, with that little preface out of the way, it's time for me to gush over this movie.Starring none other than Paul Giamatti as Paul Hunham, Giamatti plays a professor at an all boys boarding school where, over Christmas break, he has the misfortune of looking over a group of boys, one of whom is named Angus, played by Dominic Sessa. After a rocky start, where Paul clearly doesn't get along with any of the boys, making his disdain clear and evident, he eventually finds himself alone with Angus - as well as with the school's cook, Mary Lamb, played by Da'Vine Joy Randolph - in an unexpected chain of events. What occurs after is a slice-of-life style piece of cinema that allows broken people to find comfort in each other's company.""The Holdovers"" is, without a doubt, one of my favorite movies of 2023, as well as probably one of the best movies of the year, as well. This Christmas-themed gem doesn't hold back on the drama, delivering a thoughtful blend of comedy, coming-of-age storytelling, and a touch of romance - all wrapped around a very raw, human plot-line that virtually everyone can relate to. I'm no spring chicken myself, but I found myself deeply connected to both main characters - one who is older and basically dejected with life as he knows it, and one who is younger but who feels lost, aimless, and disconnected from both family and friends. And admittedly, not everyone will have a direct parallel to these experiences, but even if you don't, you're in for a story that's bound to tug at your heartstrings... and make you laugh out loud in the process.This is a high-quality movie - from the impeccable acting to the beautiful on-location cinematography to the relatable, thought-provoking plot, every element is executed with pinpoint precision and finesse; it's a testament to the art of storytelling on the silver screen. Director Alexander Payne knows how to create an artful film, and ""The Holdovers"" is no exception. It's at once indie and art-house while simultaneously being mainstream and easily accessible; in short, it's a film for everyone that actually feels like a genuine crowdpleaser instead of a pandering mess.I'm having a difficult time describing what I liked about this movie, and the reason is because I liked almost everything about this movie. So why the 9 out of 10 rating instead of the perfect 10? Literally the only thing that's holding me back is because I would've liked a touch more romance; yes, there was romance here, but a bit more would've pushed me over the edge into 10 out of 10 territory. Besides that, this is basically a perfect film, one that I loved, and one that has become one of my favorite movies of the year, if not of all time. I am genuinely looking forward to rewatching this, and I can't wait until it becomes closer to Christmas so I can view this on my own TV, cuddled under blankets, with a glass of whiskey, and bask in the absolute heartwarming experience that is ""The Holdovers."" My recommendation: Do yourself a favor and watch this as soon as you can - you won't regret it."
"The Holdovers","evanston_dad","20 November 2023",1010,"Mid-way through ""The Holdovers,"" I started openly weeping in the movie theater, and I pretty much kept it up on and off for the rest of the movie. Sometimes, there wasn't even anything obviously sad or moving happening in the scene, and I still couldn't stop. I think it's because this movie is so kind, and kindness is a rare commodity these days. It's sad to think that a movie about characters learning to have compassion for each other and for the hardships they've been through should feel like such a rare beast, but here we are.This is Alexander Payne firing on all cylinders as a director, and though he didn't write this movie, it feels like he could have. It's an obvious throwback to the kinds of movies Hal Ashby made throughout the 1970s and is touching in exactly the same way ""Harold and Maude"" was. It's also a master class in acting from the three principal characters played by Paul Giamatti, Dominic Sessa, and Da 'Vine Joy Randolph, and I hope all three of them, and the movie overall, is remembered come Oscar time.This will easily make my top ten list for the year.Grade: A+"
"The Holdovers","Xstal","28 November 2023",810,"Now here's a film with a life affirming theme, that should encourage most viewers to think of their dreams, and cascade away all their cloaks, inhibitions, and open fresh doors to their heart's intuitions; as a teacher whose life is as stale as dead fish, whose life is the opposite of happy and bliss, meets a boy who's ignored by all those he holds dear, and a friendship is formed that is warm and sincere; it's a subtle reflection of how we get trapped, by tradition and habits and past circumstance, where surroundings like prisons can temper our thinking, to distil all our spirit, to bottles for drinking; so embrace all the chances when they come along, break out of that mould and sing your own song, open your eyes to the paths unexplored, take a stand and stand tall, and stop being ignored."
"The Holdovers","steiner-sam","10 November 2023",910,"It's a comedy-drama set from December 16, 1970, to the first week of January 1971 in an exclusive boy's boarding school in New England and Boston, Massachusetts. It follows the experiences of the ""holdovers,"" that is, the students who cannot go home over the Christmas holidays and the two Barton staff left to supervise them during the holidays.There are five holdovers: Teddy Kountze (Brady Hepner), Jason Smith (Michael Provost), and Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa) are upper-class wealthy WASP students. Alex Ollerman (Ian Dolley) is a younger Mormon student whose parents are on a mission in South America. Ye-Joon Park (Jim Kaplan) is from South Korea.Left to supervise is Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti), an unmarried ancient history teacher who was once a student at Barton and has taught there all his career. He's a demanding curmudgeon who almost everyone dislikes. African American Mary Lamb (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), the head cook, is also present; her son, a Barton grad, has just been killed in Vietnam.The film follows the shared experiences of the holdovers, though four students leave after a week when a wealthy father takes them for a ski holiday. Paul cannot contact Angus's parents, so he must stay with Paul and Mary at Barton. We also meet the school's headmaster, Hardy Woodrup (Andrew Garman), his administrative assistant, Lydia Crane (Carrie Preston), and janitor Danny (Naheem Garcia).""The Holdovers"" is a delightful comedy leavened with wisdom as we learn the dark secrets that have shaped Paul Hunham and Angus Tully. Giamatti, Sessa, and Randolph are all excellent. The script unfolds the twists and turns superbly. ""The Holdovers"" is a great Christmas movie."
"The Holdovers","JohnDeSando","16 November 2023",NA,"""I find the world a bitter and complicated place. And it seems to feel the same way about me."" Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti)Teaching privileged boys at an elite new England prep school called Barton (think for example, Philips Exeter), might be the pinnacle of an academic's career. But not Paul Hunham in The Holdovers, an elite movie itself of the year.Paul should be teaching classics at an ivy school, not teaching entitled ""vermin,"" among the many sobriquets he tosses around about the fortunate young men to experience his brand of grumpy intellectualism and misanthropy. He prepares them for a world that won't always be coddling and protecting them as their family wealth so naturally does in their early years.Director Alexander Payne worked with Giamatti in Sideways, so he is prepared to have another winning cynical character who is endearing while distanced by negative temperament from normally positive fellow humans (Paul's last name, Hunham, suggests a distant connection with the better angels of humanity).As Paul accepts the assignment to supervise holdovers (exiled to Christmas vacation in the absence of parents or guardians), the number whittles down to just Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa, reminiscent of young, Timothy Chalamet and Adam Driver), who shares Paul's dark attitudes and, with the sharp writing of David Hemingson, some witty dialogue- e.g., about Paul he says, ""I thought all of the Nazis had left for Argentina.""Although, as in likeminded dramas such as Dead Poet's Society or Goodbye, Mr. Chips, the principals are destined to be transformed into more humane characters, Holdovers continues, even in its denouement, to accentuate the unsunny side of life for Paul and Tully, whose fortunes are still compromised by cold-hearted parents and administrators. The chilly world, however, is warmed on these lovely, snowbound days, by women, viz., the cook, Mary (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) and administrator Lydia (Carrie Preston).Mary good-naturedly deals with the death of her son, Curtis, a Barton grad who had to join the military because he did not have the resources as other Barton grads of the late '60s did to avoid the draft.Lydia, an attractive middle-aged staff member, holds the promise of a love interest for Paul, only to show how difficult it is for social exiles to enter the romantic mainstream.The Holdovers is a small gem of a move that will immediately remind buffs about Hal Ashby comedies of the same era like Harold & Maude, where character development is paramount and detachment from the mainstream is required to look at humanity clearly with its foibles and endearments.The Holdovers is a movie everyone can enjoy with endearing characters who share with us our moments about loneliness peppered with the possibilities of love and happiness.""Do you think I want to be babysitting you? No. I was praying your mother would pick up the phone, or your father would arrive in a helicopter or a flying saucer...."" Paul Hunham."
"The Holdovers","dtswpod","6 November 2023",810,"Do you miss how they used to make films in the 1970s? Plenty of filmmakers do, except they take that nostalgia and just do watered down versions of better movies. As an example see Taxi Driver and King of Comedy then watch Joker and you'll get what I mean.Thankfully, Alexander Payne has managed to take his sentimentality and make an original film out of it. Or if The Holdovers is a pale imitation of a superior picture then the filmmaker has managed to trick me because I don't feel as if I've seen this movie before but done better.Now to be clear, there aren't things you've never seen before in the movie. I mean, you know the characters are going to bond at some point. And people will grow to care about each other. That's a given. How we get there, however, is what makes the film seem fresh and entertaining and ever bit as good as any flick made back in the day.I hope more people see it."
"The Holdovers","tdwillis-26273","7 December 2023",810,"Finally......a GOOD movie. The story/script, although not a breakthrough idea, was heartfelt,full and real.The settings were also real and gorgeous (not really a cgi fan)
Camera, cinematography, lighting,sound,score....every level made my eyes and ears satisfyingly full.Acting was oscarworthy across the board.Directing was brilliant.Only negative I can come up with is that the pace was a bit slow, but so much of the movie is so focused and so superbly and beautifully made I just sat back and enjoyed it.A very thoughtful substantial and beautiful movie. A rare gem in today's superficial gimmicky movie making world."
"The Holdovers","ferguson-6","8 November 2023",810,"Greetings again from the darkness. We've all had that teacher. You know, the one with an evil streak who just seemed to thrive on making students miserable. Throw in a staff and administrators who feel the same way, and the casting choice for the teacher becomes obvious. Enter the always great and perfectly curmudgeonly Paul Giamatti. This is the first time Giamatti has worked with two-time Oscar winner Alexander Payne since their brilliant SIDEWAYS (2004), and it's clear these two share a wavelength for comedy and drama, even in throwback form.Paul Hunham (Giamatti) is a long-time professor at Barton Academy, an all-boys private prep school located in the snowy northeast. It's December 1970, and an early scene exemplifies how he relishes the failing grades he bestows upon desperate students so afraid to disappoint their rich parents. In the final class before the holiday break, the student-teacher banter doesn't go so well for the boys, and they head to break with an extra workload. Hunham is easily manipulated into babysitting the titular holdovers - students stuck at school over the break, while most others spend time with family, often on exotic trips.Initially there are five students, but after a certain development, what remains is Hunham, smart but troubled Angus Tully (first timer Dominic Sessa) and the school's head cook, Mary Lamb (a divine Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019). Hunham is perpetually annoyed and has a weakness for booze. Angus is frustrated that his mother left him at school so she could travel with her new husband, and Mary is grieving over her son who was killed in Vietnam. Watching these three struggle to bond is a case study in psychology, yet of course we know they will ultimately form a family of misfits, depending on each other to offset the loneliness.The genius tagline for the film is ""Discomfort and Joy"", and initially the first overshadows the latter. Isolated from the world in their own way, the three characters begin to influence each other, showing broken/wounded people need and deserve love and friendship as much as anyone else. ""Entre nous"" (just between us) becomes a kind of calling card for this trio, and a Christmas party thrown by an eternally optimistic staffer (Carrie Preston) is a turning point.Giamatti is master of this material and only goes over the top a time or two. It's painful and humorous each time he is so anxious to infuse his breadth of ancient civilization facts into even the most mundane conversations. Newcomer Sessa possesses star potential and nails a complex first role. Da'Vine Joy Randolph's Mary is the heart of the film, doling out advice to Hunham and comfort to Angus. Depression is a vein running through these characters and it's acknowledged, though not the focus.This is Alexander Payne's first film since the disappointing DOWNSIZING (2017), but his brilliance has been proven in ABOUT SCHMIDT (2002), SIDEWAYS (2004), THE DESCENDANTS (2011), and NEBRASKA (2013). This time he's working from a screenplay by successful TV writer, David Hemingson, and though there is never much suspense about where the story or characters are headed, we enjoy the ride immensely. Cinematography from Eigil Byrld (IN BRUGES, 2008), perfectly complements the emotions (shot on digital, graininess added in post), and the soundtrack is period-specific, including the great Cat Stevens. Pay attention to the retro opening credits and logos, and enjoy a smart and funny film (an Alexander Payne trademark).Opening in theaters November 10, 2023."
"The Holdovers","akcenat","1 January 2024",810,"""The Holdovers"" is a captivating blend of comedy and drama that beautifully explores the complexities of human relationships.Story is about a grumpy instructor (Paul Giamatti) at a New England prep school who forms an unexpected bond with a troubled student during the Christmas break. Because it is set in the 1970s, the film in a way is a nostalgic journey back in time, but with a narrative that is both engaging and thought-provoking.The performances are exceptional, with Giamatti delivering a compelling portrayal of a man grappling with his own loneliness and the challenges of mentorship. The film's narrative is richly layered, exploring themes of loneliness, friendship, and personal growth. It's a story that resonates, offering a poignant reflection on the human condition. The film's setting in the 1970s adds a layer of nostalgia, further enhancing the emotional depth of the narrative. Despite its lengthy runtime, ""The Holdovers"" mostly maintains a steady pace, balancing its dramatic elements with moments of humor and warmth. The main plus of the movie is its dialogue-driven approach that adds to its charm, creating a sense of authenticity and depth in its character interactions.Overall, this is a film that leaves a lasting impression, offering a thoughtful exploration of human relationships set against the backdrop of a bygone era. With its exceptional performances and engaging narrative, I'm giving it an 8 out of 10 rating. It's a must-watch for those seeking a film that combines drama, comedy, and a touch of nostalgia."
"The Holdovers","Quinoa1984","30 October 2023",1010,"The Holdovers is, for all of the character dynamics and dysfunction and depression and other things we find out about the leads, mostly with Mr. Hunham and Angus and how their characters over these couple of weeks turn away from the ""Barton"" way of not telling lies (because, well, sometimes context and the moment matter for telling a lie that won't really hurt, maybe), a strangely comforting film to watch. Not for all of that exactly, though what we understand slowly but surely is this is all material for comedy and tragedy in equal measure, but because of the feeling that we get with a filmmaker who is so primed and confident with material that you don't feel like it can go wrong.What is more impressive is that, as enjoyable as the first half is, it is in the ""I like this"" mode as we are introduced to this world and Hunham and Angus and Mary, but it doesn't feel so special. But I should have known Payne and writer David Hemingson were laying down the necessary groundwork for what comes the moment a) the majority of the other supporting characters leave for reasons I don't have to mention here, and b) then the characters go outside the Barton campus grounds on a holiday party and then a ""field trip"" to Boston, you get the sense moment by moment and interaction by interaction it is so sharp and cutting and wise, and one scene in particular makes the jump into ""oh, OK, this is taking off into another level of personal pain and about familial expectations and what will come with in a life measuring up to others - and why that is wrong - and... yeah, it's great"" territory.In other words, it's the kind of film I want to watch again right away simply because now that I know a little more about the characters, I'll want to experience all of the extra textures (its 1970 down to the wood paneling and the car seats), and dig a little more into those absolutely wonderful natural restrained and complete performances - we take Giamatti for granted sometimes and this is a character he should be proud of to craft, lazy-ass eyes and all; Sessa's first role and he is an immediate star; I can't be more sure of anything for the next Oscar's that, if Randolph is nominated, she will win, if nothing else for everything she does at the Christmas party scenes, and a moment looking over some objects in a room later on is so moving - and my comfort is in seeing Payne clearly loving directing this intimate character study where he can show what a comedically observant, quick witted, and heartbreaking story this all is.It's one of the best Christmas movies in several years, embodying many themes and ideals that fit like a 70s wool sweater, and I'm sure the first thing Payne must have thought after reading the script was ""whoa. This is gonna be the best Hal Ashby or Bob Rafelson movie never made... is 'The Last Holdover' too on the nose?"" Even Hunham would give this... a B+ probably (did he ever give As? Shrug)."
"The Holdovers","jjgonzalez-06426","31 October 2023",910,"Quite possibly one of the best Christmas films ever? I first saw Payne & Giamatti's previous film together, ""Sideways"" during my screenwriting training class, and it is one that I would think of for a while. Their new film, ""The Holdovers"", is hilarious, beautifully shot and acted, heartwarming, and has a great sense of grief and joy meshed together. Definitely leaning towards Randolph for Best Supporting Actress; her performance BLEW me away.Overall, I love these films. Light-hearted & comedic while also have a sense of darkness and a lot of heavy emotion to it. Definitely is one of the most heartfelt films of the year."
"The Holdovers","paul-allaer","20 November 2023",810,"As ""The Holdovers"" (2023 release; 133 min.) opens, it's 1970 and we are at the Barton HS boarding school in New England as the Fall semester wraps up. Paul Hunham, a teacher of classical studies and a curmudgeon, gets summoned by the head of school, and is told he will take charge of the 4 or 5 ""holdovers"", students who for one reason or another, cannot go home and need to stay at the boarding school for the entire Christmas break... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest from director Alexander Payne (""Sideways"", ""The Descendants""). Here he brings to the big screen what life is like in Fall of 1970 among a group of privileged HS students along with their testy classics teacher and a Black woman who runs the kitchen. On the surface of it all, this looks to be a terrible combination, but as the movie plays out, more and more is revealed. The movie is plot-heavy and I shan't say another word on that. Paul Giamatti, a regular of Payne's prior movie work, brings what I feel is one of his strongest movie roles ever. Da'Vine Joy Randolph is outstanding as the Black kitchen supervisor with a heavy heart. Dominic Sessa is frankly too old (33 in real life) to play the rebellious HS student Angus (17 in the movie), I mean, it's really really obvious. That said, Payne just hits all the right notes in this film, and this resonated with me on so many levels. Despite the serious undertones, there are quite a few funny moments in the movie as well.""The Holdovers"" premiered a few months ago at the Telluride film festival to immediate and widespread critical acclaim. There is good reason why this is currently rated 87% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. The movie opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati the weekend before last. The early Sunday evening screening where I saw this at was attended so-so (about 12-15 people). If you are in the mood for a top-notch comedy drama, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion."
"The Holdovers","imseeg","14 December 2023",610,"I am big fan of director Alexander Payne (The Descendants, Sideways) and of actor Paul Giamatti in particular. Both have teamed up before with marvellous results, but this movie has got 1 problem that made me only rate it with 6 stars though:The bad:the middle part of this story stretches out too long, with several quite tedious scenes, which could have easily been cut out of it without hurting the storyline. I started watching at my watch half way through several times because of this lack of spark and punch. Such a pity!Fortunately this movie picked up momentum again towards the warmhearted Christmas spirited final, but I still will only award this movie with 6 stars (instead of 7) because I got bored at many moments during the somewhat tedious and long middle part.The story: It's about a young student and his teacher, who both are lonely souls and although they cant stand each other at first, eventually slowly do bond with each other during a Christmas holiday. Acting by Paul Giamatti is masterful (as always), BUT some of the other actors fail to impress me.Not the best of director Alexander Payne's work, but definitely still worth a watch, because it left me in my seat with a smile on my face and a feel good Christmas spirit of caring for one another!"
"The Holdovers","cparousis-30615","1 January 2024",1010,"Sad, poignant, funny, and beautiful are words that best describe this film. If this film doesn't make you feel sone kind of emotion, you are absolutely heartless. You love these characters. You feel for them on every single level. The film itself feels like a film from the 70s. The twists and turns the film takes are wonderful and heartwarming/heartbreaking. Paul Giamatti is excellent as always. This is Dominic Sessa's first film and he does an outstanding job. No crazy special effects or bloated explosions. Just great filmmaking. It's streaming on Peacock. An absolute holiday must. Take the time to watch it. You'll love it."
"The Holdovers","arfdawg-1","26 December 2023",510,"Lots of great reviews here. Many people who have seen Sideways seem to be excited that Giamatti has re-teamed with Payne the director.Of course, the film is in no way related to the other movie, except that both were involved and that Sideways has quite a cult following.Unfortunately this is not my type of movie. I'm not saying it's bad. And I'm not saying anything bad about the people who seem to love it. It's just not for me.It's a character driven movie, which is fine, except I didnt bond with any of the characters. And I found the choice of musical tunes throughout to be annoying at best.So if you like drawn out period piece character driven flicks, you may like this one. I didn't love it, but I could see how some might, hence the ""5"" rating."
"The Holdovers","kevin_robbins","31 December 2023",910,"My wife and I watched The Holdovers (2023) on Peacock last night. The storyline unfolds at a boarding school in Massachusetts during holiday vacation, focusing on the kids with nowhere to go for the holidays and the staff assigned to care for them, who happen to be facing a similar issue. Together, they work to uncover inner demons and find a way to release them, allowing everyone to truly enjoy the holiday season.Directed by Alexander Payne (Sideways), the film stars Paul Giamatti (American Splendor), Da'Vine Joy Randolph (Dolemite is my Name), Dominic Sessa, and Carrie Preston (Claws).This is an exceptionally unique holiday film, offering intriguing settings, characters, and circumstances. All facets are fascinating and worthwhile, with outstanding writing that establishes the storyline and various subplots effectively. The dialogue is absolutely superb, featuring a well-balanced blend of raw emotion, character development, and comedy. The eyebrow-raising conclusion is perfect for the characters' concluding direction.In conclusion, The Holdovers is a unique and captivating character piece that's an absolute must-see. I would score this a 9/10 and strongly recommend it."
"The Holdovers","euroGary","19 October 2023",1010,"One does not expect a Christmas film to be challenging, and this one certainly isn't. But it is a lot of fun.A boys' boarding school empties of almost all staff and pupils for the 1970/1 Festive Season. Left behind are Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti), the unpopular history teacher who has to keep an eye on the school; Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa), a teenaged pupil whose mother does not want him on her honeymoon; and Mary Lamb (the impressively-named Da'Vine Joy Randolph), the school cook who is facing her first Christmas alone since her son died on military service. As these three lonely souls come together, there are tantrums, emotional revelations, the revealing of long-hidden secrets, a noble sacrifice... the usual stuff.Also the usual stuff are the characters: Paul is cynical and frustrated; Angus is ironic and insecure; and as Mary is overweight and black, she of course has to be sassy.But while in some films such predictability would be annoying, it works here. Within the limits of their somewhat two-dimensional personalities, the characters are well-written - even Angus' tantrums do not seem unreasonable. Plus, there are some great gags (""You hit him? You mean you punched him out?"" ""No, I hit him with a car..."") And I will not be the only viewer who finishes the film with a lump in his throat.Great fun. I can easily see myself buying the DVD and watching this for many Christmases to come..."
"The Holdovers","cherold","31 December 2023",810,"This movie is about a handful of entitled boys who regretfully must stay behind during the Christmas break at their private school and the teacher and cook there to oversee them.It's a funny and affecting movie with excellent performances from the leads, especially Paul giamatti as the prickly teacher.It's a Christmas movie of sorts, since it does take place at Christmas, but it's really more of an anytime of the year film in which you get to see people have adventures and fight and grow and that sort of thing.It's very well filmed, it's very entertaining, and I would recommend you watch it."
"The Holdovers","bastille-852-731547","29 October 2023",610,"Set in December 1970, ""The Holdovers"" follows a small group of students who have to stay on campus over the Christmas break at Barton Academy (a prestigious boarding school in Massachusetts,) alongside a curmudgeonly ancient history teacher (Paul Giamatti.) That sounds like a potentially amusing premise for a breezy comedy-drama, especially when Alexander Payne is directing. Having greatly enjoyed and admired several of Payne's previous films such as ""Sideways,"" ""The Descendants,"" and ""Nebraska,"" I was looking forward to this film. Overall, I found it to be simply fine and not up to par with the level of quality of most of Payne's films. There's nothing too wrong with it by any stretch of the imagination, but it's often generic and forgettable compared to Payne's other films.An indie dramedy like this film would generally be expected to be defined by being character- and writing-driven. Unfortunately, neither the characters nor the writing here are especially unique enough to structure a compelling plot around. Paul (Giamatti's character) is very generic, as is the rebellious student Angus, whose relationship with Paul is a pivotal part of the film. On a better note, Da'Vine Joy Randolph gives a strong and impactful performance as Mary, a cafeteria worker dealing with bereavement; her character is interestingly more dynamic and multi-dimensional than either Paul or Angus. The writing and humor is less unique, funny, or engaging than many of Payne's films, as the attempts at plot devices, character development, and humor often boil down to insult comedy between Paul and Angus--which, ultimately, wears out its welcome a bit, and actually causes a bit of collateral damage in making the film's tone and story feel less sincere. Regardless of the sincerity of the story, another thing that is clear here is that there needed to be a stronger and less predictable core to the plot in order for the film to remain engaging for its 133-minute runtime.The film's retro, 1970s-aesthetic is commendable and helps contribute to the atmosphere of the film, and there still are some sporadic sweet moments of Paul and Mary hanging out around the television and a few decent jokes here and there. So ""The Holdovers"" is a fine enough film, but it won't be a new holiday classic for me. 6/10."
"The Holdovers","RahulM007","31 October 2023",1010,"""Penis cancer in human form.""Alexander Payne's ""The Holdovers"" is a laugh-out-loud comedy strengthened by Paul Giamatti and Dominic Sessa's magnetic performances and their incredible chemistry together. I am in awe by the film's brilliant and inventive screenplay, 70s-style cinematography, slick editing, and great production design. I could watch Paul and Angus bicker for another two hours. Throughout the film, the humour gets more interwoven leading to a crescendo of hilarity. ""The Holdovers"" offers the perfect blend of humor and pathos.*That waitress was so rude for refusing to accept their order of cherries jubilee. She is a fascist and a ""penis cancer in human form"".*The film reminded me of Peter Weir's ""Dead Poets Society"", Milos Forman's ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", and John Hughes' ""The Breakfast Club"" (kind of).Final verdict: 10/10."
"The Holdovers","Avwillfan89","29 November 2023",910,"Finally, Alexander Payne has made a worthy follow up to his (in my opinion at least) masterpiece Sideways.I really related so much to all three of the main characters, who all come from different backgrounds. Paul Giamatti, brilliant in almost anything he does, plays a grumpy, alcoholic, sour professor who does not suffer fools and doesn't cut his privileged students any slack. Dominic Sessa is troubled teen with a dysfunctional family and mental issues. D'Avine Joy Randolf is a grieving mother stuck in a job wanting to make ends meet for her family, by her choice.This movie has great character development, a wholesome story with flawed yet lovable characters you can root for and terrific, funny dialogue. Simple, yet perfect. 9 out of 10."
"The Holdovers","frankde-jong","27 December 2023",910,"I had a lot of associations when I started watching ""The holdovers"".Kids stuck in a school during the Christmas vacation, is that not a little bit like ""The breakfast club"" (1985, John Hughes)? No, because most of the kids go away early in the film and we are left with just one pupil (Angus Tully played by Dominic Sessa) and a teacher (Paul Hunham played by Paul Giamatti).Paul Hunham teaches ancient languages and culture. Does that sounds like the Donna Tartt novel ""The secret history"" (1992)? No, in that novel the pupils are inspired by their teacher. In ""The holdovers"" the teacher is hated.One association that I did not have at all prior to watching the movie may be the most accurate: ""Scent of a woman"" (1992, Martin Brest). Also in this film a high school pupil on an expensive boarding school and a grumpy old man are condemned to each other.Best of all however we can see ""The holdovers"" as the comeback of Alexander Payne after his failed film ""Downsizing"" (2017). The film is situated in 1970 and has a very 70's look and feel, down to the aspect ratio then used. The film also contains very beautiful images of Norteast American landscapes.First of all however the film is about its three main characters. Apart from the two already introduced we have the chief cook of the boarding school Mary Lamb (Da'Vine Joy Randolph). These three people form a sort of substitute family that has to spend the Christmas season together. Each of them has his/her problems but during the film they grow closer to each other, or at least learn to understand each other better.Being a Christmas movie you expect a happy ending and somewhere in the middle of the film this happy ending seems to consist of all the members of the proxy family being on their way towards an unexpected romance. The greatness of the film is that these romances do not materialize fully. The message of the film seems to be that gaining better understanding is a happy enough ending.By the way the film does not shy away from some social criticism. The character of Paul Hunham is meant to be grumpy at first, but to me he was instantly sympathetic when he made the headmaster of the boarding school very clear that in his class wealthy parents could not buy good grades for their sons. Later he says to his pupils (at that stage of the film there are still a couple of them) that they ought to be aware of their privileged status. ""You go to Harvard, poorer boys go to Vietnam"". The Vietnam war plays an important role in the background anyway. The son of the chief cook has died in Vietnam and while visiting a bar in the village nearby the boarding school there is a local boy that lost one of his hands in Vietnam.All in all ""The holdovers"" is a very convincing comeback of Alexander Payne. He made an instant Christmas classic!"
"The Holdovers","210west","14 January 2024",410,"Alexander Payne's 1999 comedy ""Election,"" set in a Midwestern high school, was brilliant, sometimes painful, sometimes hilarious. Best of all (I say this as a onetime high school teacher), it felt refreshingly authentic.""The Holdovers"" is quite the opposite: contrived, predictable, and intended to teach -- you guessed it -- a little lesson in compassion. An hour into it, I realized that it hadn't yet contained a single moment that seemed genuine, much less surprising. Every line of dialogue sounds phony. Characters speak in little announcements, spelling things out for us. Some of the characters -- a couple of menacing townies, for example -- are mere cartoons.Giamatti's protagonist is a wholly artificial creation, designed as if in a screenwriting course to follow the approved character arc -- initially stuffy and unsympathetic to the point of caricature, ultimately vulnerable. Ironically, an early scene between him and the school's headmaster violates what's sometimes regarded as a screenwriting rule: Do NOT, even in the interest of exposition, have people telling each other what they already know. (The by-the-numbers triteness of that conversation -- meant to show us that the instructor is uncompromising and pedantic but possesses old-fashioned integrity, blah blah blah -- put me off from the start.) The scenes between Giamatti and the school's cook -- in which, with the audience in mind, the two provide personal backstories and reveal their inner selves -- are painfully heavy-handed and at times so gooey that I felt sorry for the actress: ""You can't even dream a whole dream, can you?"" she is made to say at one point. ""What are you afraid of?""Yes, I know, everybody seems to love the movie. I could barely stomach it. But do check out ""Election."""
"The Holdovers","bdesdes","30 October 2023",810,"Very enjoyable film with outstanding performances and a wonderful warm vibe accompanied by the Christmas season. It's funny at times, sad at times, and feel-good. It's a story that almost all can relate to and will really touch your heart. It deals with so many themes, but mainly grief, the past, family, and what makes a person who they are. It's also very original and has a great script, cinematography, and soundtrack. I would highly advise to see it in the theaters as well as you really get the 70's vibe and deep moment on the big screen. There aren't many negatives to this film and I would recommend it to most people."

The Holdovers is a strong and warm-hearted piece that gives actors roles with powerful lines, without any reliance on flashy editing and being overwhelmed by special effects.The story is simple three people get stuck for the Christmas holidays in a boarding school. It's cold, lonely, and boring for the parties involved. The adults drink to cope with whatever pressures they live with. The young man resorts to bad behavior and altercations with the teacher in charge.Through the vacation period these people will get to interact and get to know each other, something that will prove to a challenge to say the least. As the story evolves, we get to understand what has made the people who they are. We get to feel their pain and frustration through the very insightful writing of the director.It's a strong film with superb acting by the main leads. They have great chemistry together.Most outstanding is Paul Giamatti who plays the tormented and defensive man with relish and speaks volumes with his eyes.Hope the academy honors his performance as the best the year because no one else so far is coming close."
"The Holdovers","darkreignn","29 October 2023",910,"Let's just get this out of the way now - when it comes to writing this review, I'm probably a little bit biased (and a little bit drunk, currently, but that's besides the point). You see, I have an affinity for indie coming of age movies, and ""The Holdovers"" is basically an indie coming of age film, so it may - or may not - come as a surprise to you that I absolutely adored this picture. So, with that little preface out of the way, it's time for me to gush over this movie.Starring none other than Paul Giamatti as Paul Hunham, Giamatti plays a professor at an all boys boarding school where, over Christmas break, he has the misfortune of looking over a group of boys, one of whom is named Angus, played by Dominic Sessa. After a rocky start, where Paul clearly doesn't get along with any of the boys, making his disdain clear and evident, he eventually finds himself alone with Angus - as well as with the school's cook, Mary Lamb, played by Da'Vine Joy Randolph - in an unexpected chain of events. What occurs after is a slice-of-life style piece of cinema that allows broken people to find comfort in each other's company.""The Holdovers"" is, without a doubt, one of my favorite movies of 2023, as well as probably one of the best movies of the year, as well. This Christmas-themed gem doesn't hold back on the drama, delivering a thoughtful blend of comedy, coming-of-age storytelling, and a touch of romance - all wrapped around a very raw, human plot-line that virtually everyone can relate to. I'm no spring chicken myself, but I found myself deeply connected to both main characters - one who is older and basically dejected with life as he knows it, and one who is younger but who feels lost, aimless, and disconnected from both family and friends. And admittedly, not everyone will have a direct parallel to these experiences, but even if you don't, you're in for a story that's bound to tug at your heartstrings... and make you laugh out loud in the process.This is a high-quality movie - from the impeccable acting to the beautiful on-location cinematography to the relatable, thought-provoking plot, every element is executed with pinpoint precision and finesse; it's a testament to the art of storytelling on the silver screen. Director Alexander Payne knows how to create an artful film, and ""The Holdovers"" is no exception. It's at once indie and art-house while simultaneously being mainstream and easily accessible; in short, it's a film for everyone that actually feels like a genuine crowdpleaser instead of a pandering mess.I'm having a difficult time describing what I liked about this movie, and the reason is because I liked almost everything about this movie. So why the 9 out of 10 rating instead of the perfect 10? Literally the only thing that's holding me back is because I would've liked a touch more romance; yes, there was romance here, but a bit more would've pushed me over the edge into 10 out of 10 territory. Besides that, this is basically a perfect film, one that I loved, and one that has become one of my favorite movies of the year, if not of all time. I am genuinely looking forward to rewatching this, and I can't wait until it becomes closer to Christmas so I can view this on my own TV, cuddled under blankets, with a glass of whiskey, and bask in the absolute heartwarming experience that is ""The Holdovers."" My recommendation: Do yourself a favor and watch this as soon as you can - you won't regret it."
"The Holdovers","evanston_dad","20 November 2023",1010,"Mid-way through ""The Holdovers,"" I started openly weeping in the movie theater, and I pretty much kept it up on and off for the rest of the movie. Sometimes, there wasn't even anything obviously sad or moving happening in the scene, and I still couldn't stop. I think it's because this movie is so kind, and kindness is a rare commodity these days. It's sad to think that a movie about characters learning to have compassion for each other and for the hardships they've been through should feel like such a rare beast, but here we are.This is Alexander Payne firing on all cylinders as a director, and though he didn't write this movie, it feels like he could have. It's an obvious throwback to the kinds of movies Hal Ashby made throughout the 1970s and is touching in exactly the same way ""Harold and Maude"" was. It's also a master class in acting from the three principal characters played by Paul Giamatti, Dominic Sessa, and Da 'Vine Joy Randolph, and I hope all three of them, and the movie overall, is remembered come Oscar time.This will easily make my top ten list for the year.Grade: A+"
"The Holdovers","Xstal","28 November 2023",810,"Now here's a film with a life affirming theme, that should encourage most viewers to think of their dreams, and cascade away all their cloaks, inhibitions, and open fresh doors to their heart's intuitions; as a teacher whose life is as stale as dead fish, whose life is the opposite of happy and bliss, meets a boy who's ignored by all those he holds dear, and a friendship is formed that is warm and sincere; it's a subtle reflection of how we get trapped, by tradition and habits and past circumstance, where surroundings like prisons can temper our thinking, to distil all our spirit, to bottles for drinking; so embrace all the chances when they come along, break out of that mould and sing your own song, open your eyes to the paths unexplored, take a stand and stand tall, and stop being ignored."
"The Holdovers","steiner-sam","10 November 2023",910,"It's a comedy-drama set from December 16, 1970, to the first week of January 1971 in an exclusive boy's boarding school in New England and Boston, Massachusetts. It follows the experiences of the ""holdovers,"" that is, the students who cannot go home over the Christmas holidays and the two Barton staff left to supervise them during the holidays.There are five holdovers: Teddy Kountze (Brady Hepner), Jason Smith (Michael Provost), and Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa) are upper-class wealthy WASP students. Alex Ollerman (Ian Dolley) is a younger Mormon student whose parents are on a mission in South America. Ye-Joon Park (Jim Kaplan) is from South Korea.Left to supervise is Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti), an unmarried ancient history teacher who was once a student at Barton and has taught there all his career. He's a demanding curmudgeon who almost everyone dislikes. African American Mary Lamb (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), the head cook, is also present; her son, a Barton grad, has just been killed in Vietnam.The film follows the shared experiences of the holdovers, though four students leave after a week when a wealthy father takes them for a ski holiday. Paul cannot contact Angus's parents, so he must stay with Paul and Mary at Barton. We also meet the school's headmaster, Hardy Woodrup (Andrew Garman), his administrative assistant, Lydia Crane (Carrie Preston), and janitor Danny (Naheem Garcia).""The Holdovers"" is a delightful comedy leavened with wisdom as we learn the dark secrets that have shaped Paul Hunham and Angus Tully. Giamatti, Sessa, and Randolph are all excellent. The script unfolds the twists and turns superbly. ""The Holdovers"" is a great Christmas movie."
"The Holdovers","JohnDeSando","16 November 2023",NA,"""I find the world a bitter and complicated place. And it seems to feel the same way about me."" Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti)Teaching privileged boys at an elite new England prep school called Barton (think for example, Philips Exeter), might be the pinnacle of an academic's career. But not Paul Hunham in The Holdovers, an elite movie itself of the year.Paul should be teaching classics at an ivy school, not teaching entitled ""vermin,"" among the many sobriquets he tosses around about the fortunate young men to experience his brand of grumpy intellectualism and misanthropy. He prepares them for a world that won't always be coddling and protecting them as their family wealth so naturally does in their early years.Director Alexander Payne worked with Giamatti in Sideways, so he is prepared to have another winning cynical character who is endearing while distanced by negative temperament from normally positive fellow humans (Paul's last name, Hunham, suggests a distant connection with the better angels of humanity).As Paul accepts the assignment to supervise holdovers (exiled to Christmas vacation in the absence of parents or guardians), the number whittles down to just Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa, reminiscent of young, Timothy Chalamet and Adam Driver), who shares Paul's dark attitudes and, with the sharp writing of David Hemingson, some witty dialogue- e.g., about Paul he says, ""I thought all of the Nazis had left for Argentina.""Although, as in likeminded dramas such as Dead Poet's Society or Goodbye, Mr. Chips, the principals are destined to be transformed into more humane characters, Holdovers continues, even in its denouement, to accentuate the unsunny side of life for Paul and Tully, whose fortunes are still compromised by cold-hearted parents and administrators. The chilly world, however, is warmed on these lovely, snowbound days, by women, viz., the cook, Mary (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) and administrator Lydia (Carrie Preston).Mary good-naturedly deals with the death of her son, Curtis, a Barton grad who had to join the military because he did not have the resources as other Barton grads of the late '60s did to avoid the draft.Lydia, an attractive middle-aged staff member, holds the promise of a love interest for Paul, only to show how difficult it is for social exiles to enter the romantic mainstream.The Holdovers is a small gem of a move that will immediately remind buffs about Hal Ashby comedies of the same era like Harold & Maude, where character development is paramount and detachment from the mainstream is required to look at humanity clearly with its foibles and endearments.The Holdovers is a movie everyone can enjoy with endearing characters who share with us our moments about loneliness peppered with the possibilities of love and happiness.""Do you think I want to be babysitting you? No. I was praying your mother would pick up the phone, or your father would arrive in a helicopter or a flying saucer...."" Paul Hunham."
"The Holdovers","dtswpod","6 November 2023",810,"Do you miss how they used to make films in the 1970s? Plenty of filmmakers do, except they take that nostalgia and just do watered down versions of better movies. As an example see Taxi Driver and King of Comedy then watch Joker and you'll get what I mean.Thankfully, Alexander Payne has managed to take his sentimentality and make an original film out of it. Or if The Holdovers is a pale imitation of a superior picture then the filmmaker has managed to trick me because I don't feel as if I've seen this movie before but done better.Now to be clear, there aren't things you've never seen before in the movie. I mean, you know the characters are going to bond at some point. And people will grow to care about each other. That's a given. How we get there, however, is what makes the film seem fresh and entertaining and ever bit as good as any flick made back in the day.I hope more people see it."
"The Holdovers","tdwillis-26273","7 December 2023",810,"Finally......a GOOD movie. The story/script, although not a breakthrough idea, was heartfelt,full and real.The settings were also real and gorgeous (not really a cgi fan)
Camera, cinematography, lighting,sound,score....every level made my eyes and ears satisfyingly full.Acting was oscarworthy across the board.Directing was brilliant.Only negative I can come up with is that the pace was a bit slow, but so much of the movie is so focused and so superbly and beautifully made I just sat back and enjoyed it.A very thoughtful substantial and beautiful movie. A rare gem in today's superficial gimmicky movie making world."
"The Holdovers","ferguson-6","8 November 2023",810,"Greetings again from the darkness. We've all had that teacher. You know, the one with an evil streak who just seemed to thrive on making students miserable. Throw in a staff and administrators who feel the same way, and the casting choice for the teacher becomes obvious. Enter the always great and perfectly curmudgeonly Paul Giamatti. This is the first time Giamatti has worked with two-time Oscar winner Alexander Payne since their brilliant SIDEWAYS (2004), and it's clear these two share a wavelength for comedy and drama, even in throwback form.Paul Hunham (Giamatti) is a long-time professor at Barton Academy, an all-boys private prep school located in the snowy northeast. It's December 1970, and an early scene exemplifies how he relishes the failing grades he bestows upon desperate students so afraid to disappoint their rich parents. In the final class before the holiday break, the student-teacher banter doesn't go so well for the boys, and they head to break with an extra workload. Hunham is easily manipulated into babysitting the titular holdovers - students stuck at school over the break, while most others spend time with family, often on exotic trips.Initially there are five students, but after a certain development, what remains is Hunham, smart but troubled Angus Tully (first timer Dominic Sessa) and the school's head cook, Mary Lamb (a divine Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019). Hunham is perpetually annoyed and has a weakness for booze. Angus is frustrated that his mother left him at school so she could travel with her new husband, and Mary is grieving over her son who was killed in Vietnam. Watching these three struggle to bond is a case study in psychology, yet of course we know they will ultimately form a family of misfits, depending on each other to offset the loneliness.The genius tagline for the film is ""Discomfort and Joy"", and initially the first overshadows the latter. Isolated from the world in their own way, the three characters begin to influence each other, showing broken/wounded people need and deserve love and friendship as much as anyone else. ""Entre nous"" (just between us) becomes a kind of calling card for this trio, and a Christmas party thrown by an eternally optimistic staffer (Carrie Preston) is a turning point.Giamatti is master of this material and only goes over the top a time or two. It's painful and humorous each time he is so anxious to infuse his breadth of ancient civilization facts into even the most mundane conversations. Newcomer Sessa possesses star potential and nails a complex first role. Da'Vine Joy Randolph's Mary is the heart of the film, doling out advice to Hunham and comfort to Angus. Depression is a vein running through these characters and it's acknowledged, though not the focus.This is Alexander Payne's first film since the disappointing DOWNSIZING (2017), but his brilliance has been proven in ABOUT SCHMIDT (2002), SIDEWAYS (2004), THE DESCENDANTS (2011), and NEBRASKA (2013). This time he's working from a screenplay by successful TV writer, David Hemingson, and though there is never much suspense about where the story or characters are headed, we enjoy the ride immensely. Cinematography from Eigil Byrld (IN BRUGES, 2008), perfectly complements the emotions (shot on digital, graininess added in post), and the soundtrack is period-specific, including the great Cat Stevens. Pay attention to the retro opening credits and logos, and enjoy a smart and funny film (an Alexander Payne trademark).Opening in theaters November 10, 2023."
"The Holdovers","akcenat","1 January 2024",810,"""The Holdovers"" is a captivating blend of comedy and drama that beautifully explores the complexities of human relationships.Story is about a grumpy instructor (Paul Giamatti) at a New England prep school who forms an unexpected bond with a troubled student during the Christmas break. Because it is set in the 1970s, the film in a way is a nostalgic journey back in time, but with a narrative that is both engaging and thought-provoking.The performances are exceptional, with Giamatti delivering a compelling portrayal of a man grappling with his own loneliness and the challenges of mentorship. The film's narrative is richly layered, exploring themes of loneliness, friendship, and personal growth. It's a story that resonates, offering a poignant reflection on the human condition. The film's setting in the 1970s adds a layer of nostalgia, further enhancing the emotional depth of the narrative. Despite its lengthy runtime, ""The Holdovers"" mostly maintains a steady pace, balancing its dramatic elements with moments of humor and warmth. The main plus of the movie is its dialogue-driven approach that adds to its charm, creating a sense of authenticity and depth in its character interactions.Overall, this is a film that leaves a lasting impression, offering a thoughtful exploration of human relationships set against the backdrop of a bygone era. With its exceptional performances and engaging narrative, I'm giving it an 8 out of 10 rating. It's a must-watch for those seeking a film that combines drama, comedy, and a touch of nostalgia."
"The Holdovers","Quinoa1984","30 October 2023",1010,"The Holdovers is, for all of the character dynamics and dysfunction and depression and other things we find out about the leads, mostly with Mr. Hunham and Angus and how their characters over these couple of weeks turn away from the ""Barton"" way of not telling lies (because, well, sometimes context and the moment matter for telling a lie that won't really hurt, maybe), a strangely comforting film to watch. Not for all of that exactly, though what we understand slowly but surely is this is all material for comedy and tragedy in equal measure, but because of the feeling that we get with a filmmaker who is so primed and confident with material that you don't feel like it can go wrong.What is more impressive is that, as enjoyable as the first half is, it is in the ""I like this"" mode as we are introduced to this world and Hunham and Angus and Mary, but it doesn't feel so special. But I should have known Payne and writer David Hemingson were laying down the necessary groundwork for what comes the moment a) the majority of the other supporting characters leave for reasons I don't have to mention here, and b) then the characters go outside the Barton campus grounds on a holiday party and then a ""field trip"" to Boston, you get the sense moment by moment and interaction by interaction it is so sharp and cutting and wise, and one scene in particular makes the jump into ""oh, OK, this is taking off into another level of personal pain and about familial expectations and what will come with in a life measuring up to others - and why that is wrong - and... yeah, it's great"" territory.In other words, it's the kind of film I want to watch again right away simply because now that I know a little more about the characters, I'll want to experience all of the extra textures (its 1970 down to the wood paneling and the car seats), and dig a little more into those absolutely wonderful natural restrained and complete performances - we take Giamatti for granted sometimes and this is a character he should be proud of to craft, lazy-ass eyes and all; Sessa's first role and he is an immediate star; I can't be more sure of anything for the next Oscar's that, if Randolph is nominated, she will win, if nothing else for everything she does at the Christmas party scenes, and a moment looking over some objects in a room later on is so moving - and my comfort is in seeing Payne clearly loving directing this intimate character study where he can show what a comedically observant, quick witted, and heartbreaking story this all is.It's one of the best Christmas movies in several years, embodying many themes and ideals that fit like a 70s wool sweater, and I'm sure the first thing Payne must have thought after reading the script was ""whoa. This is gonna be the best Hal Ashby or Bob Rafelson movie never made... is 'The Last Holdover' too on the nose?"" Even Hunham would give this... a B+ probably (did he ever give As? Shrug)."
"The Holdovers","jjgonzalez-06426","31 October 2023",910,"Quite possibly one of the best Christmas films ever? I first saw Payne & Giamatti's previous film together, ""Sideways"" during my screenwriting training class, and it is one that I would think of for a while. Their new film, ""The Holdovers"", is hilarious, beautifully shot and acted, heartwarming, and has a great sense of grief and joy meshed together. Definitely leaning towards Randolph for Best Supporting Actress; her performance BLEW me away.Overall, I love these films. Light-hearted & comedic while also have a sense of darkness and a lot of heavy emotion to it. Definitely is one of the most heartfelt films of the year."
"The Holdovers","paul-allaer","20 November 2023",810,"As ""The Holdovers"" (2023 release; 133 min.) opens, it's 1970 and we are at the Barton HS boarding school in New England as the Fall semester wraps up. Paul Hunham, a teacher of classical studies and a curmudgeon, gets summoned by the head of school, and is told he will take charge of the 4 or 5 ""holdovers"", students who for one reason or another, cannot go home and need to stay at the boarding school for the entire Christmas break... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest from director Alexander Payne (""Sideways"", ""The Descendants""). Here he brings to the big screen what life is like in Fall of 1970 among a group of privileged HS students along with their testy classics teacher and a Black woman who runs the kitchen. On the surface of it all, this looks to be a terrible combination, but as the movie plays out, more and more is revealed. The movie is plot-heavy and I shan't say another word on that. Paul Giamatti, a regular of Payne's prior movie work, brings what I feel is one of his strongest movie roles ever. Da'Vine Joy Randolph is outstanding as the Black kitchen supervisor with a heavy heart. Dominic Sessa is frankly too old (33 in real life) to play the rebellious HS student Angus (17 in the movie), I mean, it's really really obvious. That said, Payne just hits all the right notes in this film, and this resonated with me on so many levels. Despite the serious undertones, there are quite a few funny moments in the movie as well.""The Holdovers"" premiered a few months ago at the Telluride film festival to immediate and widespread critical acclaim. There is good reason why this is currently rated 87% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. The movie opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati the weekend before last. The early Sunday evening screening where I saw this at was attended so-so (about 12-15 people). If you are in the mood for a top-notch comedy drama, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion."
"The Holdovers","imseeg","14 December 2023",610,"I am big fan of director Alexander Payne (The Descendants, Sideways) and of actor Paul Giamatti in particular. Both have teamed up before with marvellous results, but this movie has got 1 problem that made me only rate it with 6 stars though:The bad:the middle part of this story stretches out too long, with several quite tedious scenes, which could have easily been cut out of it without hurting the storyline. I started watching at my watch half way through several times because of this lack of spark and punch. Such a pity!Fortunately this movie picked up momentum again towards the warmhearted Christmas spirited final, but I still will only award this movie with 6 stars (instead of 7) because I got bored at many moments during the somewhat tedious and long middle part.The story: It's about a young student and his teacher, who both are lonely souls and although they cant stand each other at first, eventually slowly do bond with each other during a Christmas holiday. Acting by Paul Giamatti is masterful (as always), BUT some of the other actors fail to impress me.Not the best of director Alexander Payne's work, but definitely still worth a watch, because it left me in my seat with a smile on my face and a feel good Christmas spirit of caring for one another!"
"The Holdovers","cparousis-30615","1 January 2024",1010,"Sad, poignant, funny, and beautiful are words that best describe this film. If this film doesn't make you feel sone kind of emotion, you are absolutely heartless. You love these characters. You feel for them on every single level. The film itself feels like a film from the 70s. The twists and turns the film takes are wonderful and heartwarming/heartbreaking. Paul Giamatti is excellent as always. This is Dominic Sessa's first film and he does an outstanding job. No crazy special effects or bloated explosions. Just great filmmaking. It's streaming on Peacock. An absolute holiday must. Take the time to watch it. You'll love it."
"The Holdovers","arfdawg-1","26 December 2023",510,"Lots of great reviews here. Many people who have seen Sideways seem to be excited that Giamatti has re-teamed with Payne the director.Of course, the film is in no way related to the other movie, except that both were involved and that Sideways has quite a cult following.Unfortunately this is not my type of movie. I'm not saying it's bad. And I'm not saying anything bad about the people who seem to love it. It's just not for me.It's a character driven movie, which is fine, except I didnt bond with any of the characters. And I found the choice of musical tunes throughout to be annoying at best.So if you like drawn out period piece character driven flicks, you may like this one. I didn't love it, but I could see how some might, hence the ""5"" rating."
"The Holdovers","kevin_robbins","31 December 2023",910,"My wife and I watched The Holdovers (2023) on Peacock last night. The storyline unfolds at a boarding school in Massachusetts during holiday vacation, focusing on the kids with nowhere to go for the holidays and the staff assigned to care for them, who happen to be facing a similar issue. Together, they work to uncover inner demons and find a way to release them, allowing everyone to truly enjoy the holiday season.Directed by Alexander Payne (Sideways), the film stars Paul Giamatti (American Splendor), Da'Vine Joy Randolph (Dolemite is my Name), Dominic Sessa, and Carrie Preston (Claws).This is an exceptionally unique holiday film, offering intriguing settings, characters, and circumstances. All facets are fascinating and worthwhile, with outstanding writing that establishes the storyline and various subplots effectively. The dialogue is absolutely superb, featuring a well-balanced blend of raw emotion, character development, and comedy. The eyebrow-raising conclusion is perfect for the characters' concluding direction.In conclusion, The Holdovers is a unique and captivating character piece that's an absolute must-see. I would score this a 9/10 and strongly recommend it."
"The Holdovers","euroGary","19 October 2023",1010,"One does not expect a Christmas film to be challenging, and this one certainly isn't. But it is a lot of fun.A boys' boarding school empties of almost all staff and pupils for the 1970/1 Festive Season. Left behind are Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti), the unpopular history teacher who has to keep an eye on the school; Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa), a teenaged pupil whose mother does not want him on her honeymoon; and Mary Lamb (the impressively-named Da'Vine Joy Randolph), the school cook who is facing her first Christmas alone since her son died on military service. As these three lonely souls come together, there are tantrums, emotional revelations, the revealing of long-hidden secrets, a noble sacrifice... the usual stuff.Also the usual stuff are the characters: Paul is cynical and frustrated; Angus is ironic and insecure; and as Mary is overweight and black, she of course has to be sassy.But while in some films such predictability would be annoying, it works here. Within the limits of their somewhat two-dimensional personalities, the characters are well-written - even Angus' tantrums do not seem unreasonable. Plus, there are some great gags (""You hit him? You mean you punched him out?"" ""No, I hit him with a car..."") And I will not be the only viewer who finishes the film with a lump in his throat.Great fun. I can easily see myself buying the DVD and watching this for many Christmases to come..."
"The Holdovers","cherold","31 December 2023",810,"This movie is about a handful of entitled boys who regretfully must stay behind during the Christmas break at their private school and the teacher and cook there to oversee them.It's a funny and affecting movie with excellent performances from the leads, especially Paul giamatti as the prickly teacher.It's a Christmas movie of sorts, since it does take place at Christmas, but it's really more of an anytime of the year film in which you get to see people have adventures and fight and grow and that sort of thing.It's very well filmed, it's very entertaining, and I would recommend you watch it."
"The Holdovers","bastille-852-731547","29 October 2023",610,"Set in December 1970, ""The Holdovers"" follows a small group of students who have to stay on campus over the Christmas break at Barton Academy (a prestigious boarding school in Massachusetts,) alongside a curmudgeonly ancient history teacher (Paul Giamatti.) That sounds like a potentially amusing premise for a breezy comedy-drama, especially when Alexander Payne is directing. Having greatly enjoyed and admired several of Payne's previous films such as ""Sideways,"" ""The Descendants,"" and ""Nebraska,"" I was looking forward to this film. Overall, I found it to be simply fine and not up to par with the level of quality of most of Payne's films. There's nothing too wrong with it by any stretch of the imagination, but it's often generic and forgettable compared to Payne's other films.An indie dramedy like this film would generally be expected to be defined by being character- and writing-driven. Unfortunately, neither the characters nor the writing here are especially unique enough to structure a compelling plot around. Paul (Giamatti's character) is very generic, as is the rebellious student Angus, whose relationship with Paul is a pivotal part of the film. On a better note, Da'Vine Joy Randolph gives a strong and impactful performance as Mary, a cafeteria worker dealing with bereavement; her character is interestingly more dynamic and multi-dimensional than either Paul or Angus. The writing and humor is less unique, funny, or engaging than many of Payne's films, as the attempts at plot devices, character development, and humor often boil down to insult comedy between Paul and Angus--which, ultimately, wears out its welcome a bit, and actually causes a bit of collateral damage in making the film's tone and story feel less sincere. Regardless of the sincerity of the story, another thing that is clear here is that there needed to be a stronger and less predictable core to the plot in order for the film to remain engaging for its 133-minute runtime.The film's retro, 1970s-aesthetic is commendable and helps contribute to the atmosphere of the film, and there still are some sporadic sweet moments of Paul and Mary hanging out around the television and a few decent jokes here and there. So ""The Holdovers"" is a fine enough film, but it won't be a new holiday classic for me. 6/10."
"The Holdovers","RahulM007","31 October 2023",1010,"""Penis cancer in human form.""Alexander Payne's ""The Holdovers"" is a laugh-out-loud comedy strengthened by Paul Giamatti and Dominic Sessa's magnetic performances and their incredible chemistry together. I am in awe by the film's brilliant and inventive screenplay, 70s-style cinematography, slick editing, and great production design. I could watch Paul and Angus bicker for another two hours. Throughout the film, the humour gets more interwoven leading to a crescendo of hilarity. ""The Holdovers"" offers the perfect blend of humor and pathos.*That waitress was so rude for refusing to accept their order of cherries jubilee. She is a fascist and a ""penis cancer in human form"".*The film reminded me of Peter Weir's ""Dead Poets Society"", Milos Forman's ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", and John Hughes' ""The Breakfast Club"" (kind of).Final verdict: 10/10."
"The Holdovers","Avwillfan89","29 November 2023",910,"Finally, Alexander Payne has made a worthy follow up to his (in my opinion at least) masterpiece Sideways.I really related so much to all three of the main characters, who all come from different backgrounds. Paul Giamatti, brilliant in almost anything he does, plays a grumpy, alcoholic, sour professor who does not suffer fools and doesn't cut his privileged students any slack. Dominic Sessa is troubled teen with a dysfunctional family and mental issues. D'Avine Joy Randolf is a grieving mother stuck in a job wanting to make ends meet for her family, by her choice.This movie has great character development, a wholesome story with flawed yet lovable characters you can root for and terrific, funny dialogue. Simple, yet perfect. 9 out of 10."
"The Holdovers","frankde-jong","27 December 2023",910,"I had a lot of associations when I started watching ""The holdovers"".Kids stuck in a school during the Christmas vacation, is that not a little bit like ""The breakfast club"" (1985, John Hughes)? No, because most of the kids go away early in the film and we are left with just one pupil (Angus Tully played by Dominic Sessa) and a teacher (Paul Hunham played by Paul Giamatti).Paul Hunham teaches ancient languages and culture. Does that sounds like the Donna Tartt novel ""The secret history"" (1992)? No, in that novel the pupils are inspired by their teacher. In ""The holdovers"" the teacher is hated.One association that I did not have at all prior to watching the movie may be the most accurate: ""Scent of a woman"" (1992, Martin Brest). Also in this film a high school pupil on an expensive boarding school and a grumpy old man are condemned to each other.Best of all however we can see ""The holdovers"" as the comeback of Alexander Payne after his failed film ""Downsizing"" (2017). The film is situated in 1970 and has a very 70's look and feel, down to the aspect ratio then used. The film also contains very beautiful images of Norteast American landscapes.First of all however the film is about its three main characters. Apart from the two already introduced we have the chief cook of the boarding school Mary Lamb (Da'Vine Joy Randolph). These three people form a sort of substitute family that has to spend the Christmas season together. Each of them has his/her problems but during the film they grow closer to each other, or at least learn to understand each other better.Being a Christmas movie you expect a happy ending and somewhere in the middle of the film this happy ending seems to consist of all the members of the proxy family being on their way towards an unexpected romance. The greatness of the film is that these romances do not materialize fully. The message of the film seems to be that gaining better understanding is a happy enough ending.By the way the film does not shy away from some social criticism. The character of Paul Hunham is meant to be grumpy at first, but to me he was instantly sympathetic when he made the headmaster of the boarding school very clear that in his class wealthy parents could not buy good grades for their sons. Later he says to his pupils (at that stage of the film there are still a couple of them) that they ought to be aware of their privileged status. ""You go to Harvard, poorer boys go to Vietnam"". The Vietnam war plays an important role in the background anyway. The son of the chief cook has died in Vietnam and while visiting a bar in the village nearby the boarding school there is a local boy that lost one of his hands in Vietnam.All in all ""The holdovers"" is a very convincing comeback of Alexander Payne. He made an instant Christmas classic!"
"The Holdovers","210west","14 January 2024",410,"Alexander Payne's 1999 comedy ""Election,"" set in a Midwestern high school, was brilliant, sometimes painful, sometimes hilarious. Best of all (I say this as a onetime high school teacher), it felt refreshingly authentic.""The Holdovers"" is quite the opposite: contrived, predictable, and intended to teach -- you guessed it -- a little lesson in compassion. An hour into it, I realized that it hadn't yet contained a single moment that seemed genuine, much less surprising. Every line of dialogue sounds phony. Characters speak in little announcements, spelling things out for us. Some of the characters -- a couple of menacing townies, for example -- are mere cartoons.Giamatti's protagonist is a wholly artificial creation, designed as if in a screenwriting course to follow the approved character arc -- initially stuffy and unsympathetic to the point of caricature, ultimately vulnerable. Ironically, an early scene between him and the school's headmaster violates what's sometimes regarded as a screenwriting rule: Do NOT, even in the interest of exposition, have people telling each other what they already know. (The by-the-numbers triteness of that conversation -- meant to show us that the instructor is uncompromising and pedantic but possesses old-fashioned integrity, blah blah blah -- put me off from the start.) The scenes between Giamatti and the school's cook -- in which, with the audience in mind, the two provide personal backstories and reveal their inner selves -- are painfully heavy-handed and at times so gooey that I felt sorry for the actress: ""You can't even dream a whole dream, can you?"" she is made to say at one point. ""What are you afraid of?""Yes, I know, everybody seems to love the movie. I could barely stomach it. But do check out ""Election."""
"The Holdovers","bdesdes","30 October 2023",810,"Very enjoyable film with outstanding performances and a wonderful warm vibe accompanied by the Christmas season. It's funny at times, sad at times, and feel-good. It's a story that almost all can relate to and will really touch your heart. It deals with so many themes, but mainly grief, the past, family, and what makes a person who they are. It's also very original and has a great script, cinematography, and soundtrack. I would highly advise to see it in the theaters as well as you really get the 70's vibe and deep moment on the big screen. There aren't many negatives to this film and I would recommend it to most people."
"The Holdovers","aharmas","29 October 2023",1010,"Here is a film that feels and looks like something out of the early seventies. The Holdovers is a strong and warm-hearted piece that gives actors roles with powerful lines, without any reliance on flashy editing and being overwhelmed by special effects.The story is simple three people get stuck for the Christmas holidays in a boarding school. It's cold, lonely, and boring for the parties involved. The adults drink to cope with whatever pressures they live with. The young man resorts to bad behavior and altercations with the teacher in charge.Through the vacation period these people will get to interact and get to know each other, something that will prove to a challenge to say the least. As the story evolves, we get to understand what has made the people who they are. We get to feel their pain and frustration through the very insightful writing of the director.It's a strong film with superb acting by the main leads. They have great chemistry together.Most outstanding is Paul Giamatti who plays the tormented and defensive man with relish and speaks volumes with his eyes.Hope the academy honors his performance as the best the year because no one else so far is coming close."
"The Holdovers","darkreignn","29 October 2023",910,"Let's just get this out of the way now - when it comes to writing this review, I'm probably a little bit biased (and a little bit drunk, currently, but that's besides the point). You see, I have an affinity for indie coming of age movies, and ""The Holdovers"" is basically an indie coming of age film, so it may - or may not - come as a surprise to you that I absolutely adored this picture. So, with that little preface out of the way, it's time for me to gush over this movie.Starring none other than Paul Giamatti as Paul Hunham, Giamatti plays a professor at an all boys boarding school where, over Christmas break, he has the misfortune of looking over a group of boys, one of whom is named Angus, played by Dominic Sessa. After a rocky start, where Paul clearly doesn't get along with any of the boys, making his disdain clear and evident, he eventually finds himself alone with Angus - as well as with the school's cook, Mary Lamb, played by Da'Vine Joy Randolph - in an unexpected chain of events. What occurs after is a slice-of-life style piece of cinema that allows broken people to find comfort in each other's company.""The Holdovers"" is, without a doubt, one of my favorite movies of 2023, as well as probably one of the best movies of the year, as well. This Christmas-themed gem doesn't hold back on the drama, delivering a thoughtful blend of comedy, coming-of-age storytelling, and a touch of romance - all wrapped around a very raw, human plot-line that virtually everyone can relate to. I'm no spring chicken myself, but I found myself deeply connected to both main characters - one who is older and basically dejected with life as he knows it, and one who is younger but who feels lost, aimless, and disconnected from both family and friends. And admittedly, not everyone will have a direct parallel to these experiences, but even if you don't, you're in for a story that's bound to tug at your heartstrings... and make you laugh out loud in the process.This is a high-quality movie - from the impeccable acting to the beautiful on-location cinematography to the relatable, thought-provoking plot, every element is executed with pinpoint precision and finesse; it's a testament to the art of storytelling on the silver screen. Director Alexander Payne knows how to create an artful film, and ""The Holdovers"" is no exception. It's at once indie and art-house while simultaneously being mainstream and easily accessible; in short, it's a film for everyone that actually feels like a genuine crowdpleaser instead of a pandering mess.I'm having a difficult time describing what I liked about this movie, and the reason is because I liked almost everything about this movie. So why the 9 out of 10 rating instead of the perfect 10? Literally the only thing that's holding me back is because I would've liked a touch more romance; yes, there was romance here, but a bit more would've pushed me over the edge into 10 out of 10 territory. Besides that, this is basically a perfect film, one that I loved, and one that has become one of my favorite movies of the year, if not of all time. I am genuinely looking forward to rewatching this, and I can't wait until it becomes closer to Christmas so I can view this on my own TV, cuddled under blankets, with a glass of whiskey, and bask in the absolute heartwarming experience that is ""The Holdovers."" My recommendation: Do yourself a favor and watch this as soon as you can - you won't regret it."
"The Holdovers","evanston_dad","20 November 2023",1010,"Mid-way through ""The Holdovers,"" I started openly weeping in the movie theater, and I pretty much kept it up on and off for the rest of the movie. Sometimes, there wasn't even anything obviously sad or moving happening in the scene, and I still couldn't stop. I think it's because this movie is so kind, and kindness is a rare commodity these days. It's sad to think that a movie about characters learning to have compassion for each other and for the hardships they've been through should feel like such a rare beast, but here we are.This is Alexander Payne firing on all cylinders as a director, and though he didn't write this movie, it feels like he could have. It's an obvious throwback to the kinds of movies Hal Ashby made throughout the 1970s and is touching in exactly the same way ""Harold and Maude"" was. It's also a master class in acting from the three principal characters played by Paul Giamatti, Dominic Sessa, and Da 'Vine Joy Randolph, and I hope all three of them, and the movie overall, is remembered come Oscar time.This will easily make my top ten list for the year.Grade: A+"
"The Holdovers","Xstal","28 November 2023",810,"Now here's a film with a life affirming theme, that should encourage most viewers to think of their dreams, and cascade away all their cloaks, inhibitions, and open fresh doors to their heart's intuitions; as a teacher whose life is as stale as dead fish, whose life is the opposite of happy and bliss, meets a boy who's ignored by all those he holds dear, and a friendship is formed that is warm and sincere; it's a subtle reflection of how we get trapped, by tradition and habits and past circumstance, where surroundings like prisons can temper our thinking, to distil all our spirit, to bottles for drinking; so embrace all the chances when they come along, break out of that mould and sing your own song, open your eyes to the paths unexplored, take a stand and stand tall, and stop being ignored."
"The Holdovers","steiner-sam","10 November 2023",910,"It's a comedy-drama set from December 16, 1970, to the first week of January 1971 in an exclusive boy's boarding school in New England and Boston, Massachusetts. It follows the experiences of the ""holdovers,"" that is, the students who cannot go home over the Christmas holidays and the two Barton staff left to supervise them during the holidays.There are five holdovers: Teddy Kountze (Brady Hepner), Jason Smith (Michael Provost), and Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa) are upper-class wealthy WASP students. Alex Ollerman (Ian Dolley) is a younger Mormon student whose parents are on a mission in South America. Ye-Joon Park (Jim Kaplan) is from South Korea.Left to supervise is Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti), an unmarried ancient history teacher who was once a student at Barton and has taught there all his career. He's a demanding curmudgeon who almost everyone dislikes. African American Mary Lamb (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), the head cook, is also present; her son, a Barton grad, has just been killed in Vietnam.The film follows the shared experiences of the holdovers, though four students leave after a week when a wealthy father takes them for a ski holiday. Paul cannot contact Angus's parents, so he must stay with Paul and Mary at Barton. We also meet the school's headmaster, Hardy Woodrup (Andrew Garman), his administrative assistant, Lydia Crane (Carrie Preston), and janitor Danny (Naheem Garcia).""The Holdovers"" is a delightful comedy leavened with wisdom as we learn the dark secrets that have shaped Paul Hunham and Angus Tully. Giamatti, Sessa, and Randolph are all excellent. The script unfolds the twists and turns superbly. ""The Holdovers"" is a great Christmas movie."
"The Holdovers","JohnDeSando","16 November 2023",NA,"""I find the world a bitter and complicated place. And it seems to feel the same way about me."" Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti)Teaching privileged boys at an elite new England prep school called Barton (think for example, Philips Exeter), might be the pinnacle of an academic's career. But not Paul Hunham in The Holdovers, an elite movie itself of the year.Paul should be teaching classics at an ivy school, not teaching entitled ""vermin,"" among the many sobriquets he tosses around about the fortunate young men to experience his brand of grumpy intellectualism and misanthropy. He prepares them for a world that won't always be coddling and protecting them as their family wealth so naturally does in their early years.Director Alexander Payne worked with Giamatti in Sideways, so he is prepared to have another winning cynical character who is endearing while distanced by negative temperament from normally positive fellow humans (Paul's last name, Hunham, suggests a distant connection with the better angels of humanity).As Paul accepts the assignment to supervise holdovers (exiled to Christmas vacation in the absence of parents or guardians), the number whittles down to just Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa, reminiscent of young, Timothy Chalamet and Adam Driver), who shares Paul's dark attitudes and, with the sharp writing of David Hemingson, some witty dialogue- e.g., about Paul he says, ""I thought all of the Nazis had left for Argentina.""Although, as in likeminded dramas such as Dead Poet's Society or Goodbye, Mr. Chips, the principals are destined to be transformed into more humane characters, Holdovers continues, even in its denouement, to accentuate the unsunny side of life for Paul and Tully, whose fortunes are still compromised by cold-hearted parents and administrators. The chilly world, however, is warmed on these lovely, snowbound days, by women, viz., the cook, Mary (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) and administrator Lydia (Carrie Preston).Mary good-naturedly deals with the death of her son, Curtis, a Barton grad who had to join the military because he did not have the resources as other Barton grads of the late '60s did to avoid the draft.Lydia, an attractive middle-aged staff member, holds the promise of a love interest for Paul, only to show how difficult it is for social exiles to enter the romantic mainstream.The Holdovers is a small gem of a move that will immediately remind buffs about Hal Ashby comedies of the same era like Harold & Maude, where character development is paramount and detachment from the mainstream is required to look at humanity clearly with its foibles and endearments.The Holdovers is a movie everyone can enjoy with endearing characters who share with us our moments about loneliness peppered with the possibilities of love and happiness.""Do you think I want to be babysitting you? No. I was praying your mother would pick up the phone, or your father would arrive in a helicopter or a flying saucer...."" Paul Hunham."
"The Holdovers","dtswpod","6 November 2023",810,"Do you miss how they used to make films in the 1970s? Plenty of filmmakers do, except they take that nostalgia and just do watered down versions of better movies. As an example see Taxi Driver and King of Comedy then watch Joker and you'll get what I mean.Thankfully, Alexander Payne has managed to take his sentimentality and make an original film out of it. Or if The Holdovers is a pale imitation of a superior picture then the filmmaker has managed to trick me because I don't feel as if I've seen this movie before but done better.Now to be clear, there aren't things you've never seen before in the movie. I mean, you know the characters are going to bond at some point. And people will grow to care about each other. That's a given. How we get there, however, is what makes the film seem fresh and entertaining and ever bit as good as any flick made back in the day.I hope more people see it."
"The Holdovers","tdwillis-26273","7 December 2023",810,"Finally......a GOOD movie. The story/script, although not a breakthrough idea, was heartfelt,full and real.The settings were also real and gorgeous (not really a cgi fan)
Camera, cinematography, lighting,sound,score....every level made my eyes and ears satisfyingly full.Acting was oscarworthy across the board.Directing was brilliant.Only negative I can come up with is that the pace was a bit slow, but so much of the movie is so focused and so superbly and beautifully made I just sat back and enjoyed it.A very thoughtful substantial and beautiful movie. A rare gem in today's superficial gimmicky movie making world."
"The Holdovers","ferguson-6","8 November 2023",810,"Greetings again from the darkness. We've all had that teacher. You know, the one with an evil streak who just seemed to thrive on making students miserable. Throw in a staff and administrators who feel the same way, and the casting choice for the teacher becomes obvious. Enter the always great and perfectly curmudgeonly Paul Giamatti. This is the first time Giamatti has worked with two-time Oscar winner Alexander Payne since their brilliant SIDEWAYS (2004), and it's clear these two share a wavelength for comedy and drama, even in throwback form.Paul Hunham (Giamatti) is a long-time professor at Barton Academy, an all-boys private prep school located in the snowy northeast. It's December 1970, and an early scene exemplifies how he relishes the failing grades he bestows upon desperate students so afraid to disappoint their rich parents. In the final class before the holiday break, the student-teacher banter doesn't go so well for the boys, and they head to break with an extra workload. Hunham is easily manipulated into babysitting the titular holdovers - students stuck at school over the break, while most others spend time with family, often on exotic trips.Initially there are five students, but after a certain development, what remains is Hunham, smart but troubled Angus Tully (first timer Dominic Sessa) and the school's head cook, Mary Lamb (a divine Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019). Hunham is perpetually annoyed and has a weakness for booze. Angus is frustrated that his mother left him at school so she could travel with her new husband, and Mary is grieving over her son who was killed in Vietnam. Watching these three struggle to bond is a case study in psychology, yet of course we know they will ultimately form a family of misfits, depending on each other to offset the loneliness.The genius tagline for the film is ""Discomfort and Joy"", and initially the first overshadows the latter. Isolated from the world in their own way, the three characters begin to influence each other, showing broken/wounded people need and deserve love and friendship as much as anyone else. ""Entre nous"" (just between us) becomes a kind of calling card for this trio, and a Christmas party thrown by an eternally optimistic staffer (Carrie Preston) is a turning point.Giamatti is master of this material and only goes over the top a time or two. It's painful and humorous each time he is so anxious to infuse his breadth of ancient civilization facts into even the most mundane conversations. Newcomer Sessa possesses star potential and nails a complex first role. Da'Vine Joy Randolph's Mary is the heart of the film, doling out advice to Hunham and comfort to Angus. Depression is a vein running through these characters and it's acknowledged, though not the focus.This is Alexander Payne's first film since the disappointing DOWNSIZING (2017), but his brilliance has been proven in ABOUT SCHMIDT (2002), SIDEWAYS (2004), THE DESCENDANTS (2011), and NEBRASKA (2013). This time he's working from a screenplay by successful TV writer, David Hemingson, and though there is never much suspense about where the story or characters are headed, we enjoy the ride immensely. Cinematography from Eigil Byrld (IN BRUGES, 2008), perfectly complements the emotions (shot on digital, graininess added in post), and the soundtrack is period-specific, including the great Cat Stevens. Pay attention to the retro opening credits and logos, and enjoy a smart and funny film (an Alexander Payne trademark).Opening in theaters November 10, 2023."
"The Holdovers","akcenat","1 January 2024",810,"""The Holdovers"" is a captivating blend of comedy and drama that beautifully explores the complexities of human relationships.Story is about a grumpy instructor (Paul Giamatti) at a New England prep school who forms an unexpected bond with a troubled student during the Christmas break. Because it is set in the 1970s, the film in a way is a nostalgic journey back in time, but with a narrative that is both engaging and thought-provoking.The performances are exceptional, with Giamatti delivering a compelling portrayal of a man grappling with his own loneliness and the challenges of mentorship. The film's narrative is richly layered, exploring themes of loneliness, friendship, and personal growth. It's a story that resonates, offering a poignant reflection on the human condition. The film's setting in the 1970s adds a layer of nostalgia, further enhancing the emotional depth of the narrative. Despite its lengthy runtime, ""The Holdovers"" mostly maintains a steady pace, balancing its dramatic elements with moments of humor and warmth. The main plus of the movie is its dialogue-driven approach that adds to its charm, creating a sense of authenticity and depth in its character interactions.Overall, this is a film that leaves a lasting impression, offering a thoughtful exploration of human relationships set against the backdrop of a bygone era. With its exceptional performances and engaging narrative, I'm giving it an 8 out of 10 rating. It's a must-watch for those seeking a film that combines drama, comedy, and a touch of nostalgia."
"The Holdovers","Quinoa1984","30 October 2023",1010,"The Holdovers is, for all of the character dynamics and dysfunction and depression and other things we find out about the leads, mostly with Mr. Hunham and Angus and how their characters over these couple of weeks turn away from the ""Barton"" way of not telling lies (because, well, sometimes context and the moment matter for telling a lie that won't really hurt, maybe), a strangely comforting film to watch. Not for all of that exactly, though what we understand slowly but surely is this is all material for comedy and tragedy in equal measure, but because of the feeling that we get with a filmmaker who is so primed and confident with material that you don't feel like it can go wrong.What is more impressive is that, as enjoyable as the first half is, it is in the ""I like this"" mode as we are introduced to this world and Hunham and Angus and Mary, but it doesn't feel so special. But I should have known Payne and writer David Hemingson were laying down the necessary groundwork for what comes the moment a) the majority of the other supporting characters leave for reasons I don't have to mention here, and b) then the characters go outside the Barton campus grounds on a holiday party and then a ""field trip"" to Boston, you get the sense moment by moment and interaction by interaction it is so sharp and cutting and wise, and one scene in particular makes the jump into ""oh, OK, this is taking off into another level of personal pain and about familial expectations and what will come with in a life measuring up to others - and why that is wrong - and... yeah, it's great"" territory.In other words, it's the kind of film I want to watch again right away simply because now that I know a little more about the characters, I'll want to experience all of the extra textures (its 1970 down to the wood paneling and the car seats), and dig a little more into those absolutely wonderful natural restrained and complete performances - we take Giamatti for granted sometimes and this is a character he should be proud of to craft, lazy-ass eyes and all; Sessa's first role and he is an immediate star; I can't be more sure of anything for the next Oscar's that, if Randolph is nominated, she will win, if nothing else for everything she does at the Christmas party scenes, and a moment looking over some objects in a room later on is so moving - and my comfort is in seeing Payne clearly loving directing this intimate character study where he can show what a comedically observant, quick witted, and heartbreaking story this all is.It's one of the best Christmas movies in several years, embodying many themes and ideals that fit like a 70s wool sweater, and I'm sure the first thing Payne must have thought after reading the script was ""whoa. This is gonna be the best Hal Ashby or Bob Rafelson movie never made... is 'The Last Holdover' too on the nose?"" Even Hunham would give this... a B+ probably (did he ever give As? Shrug)."
"The Holdovers","jjgonzalez-06426","31 October 2023",910,"Quite possibly one of the best Christmas films ever? I first saw Payne & Giamatti's previous film together, ""Sideways"" during my screenwriting training class, and it is one that I would think of for a while. Their new film, ""The Holdovers"", is hilarious, beautifully shot and acted, heartwarming, and has a great sense of grief and joy meshed together. Definitely leaning towards Randolph for Best Supporting Actress; her performance BLEW me away.Overall, I love these films. Light-hearted & comedic while also have a sense of darkness and a lot of heavy emotion to it. Definitely is one of the most heartfelt films of the year."
"The Holdovers","paul-allaer","20 November 2023",810,"As ""The Holdovers"" (2023 release; 133 min.) opens, it's 1970 and we are at the Barton HS boarding school in New England as the Fall semester wraps up. Paul Hunham, a teacher of classical studies and a curmudgeon, gets summoned by the head of school, and is told he will take charge of the 4 or 5 ""holdovers"", students who for one reason or another, cannot go home and need to stay at the boarding school for the entire Christmas break... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest from director Alexander Payne (""Sideways"", ""The Descendants""). Here he brings to the big screen what life is like in Fall of 1970 among a group of privileged HS students along with their testy classics teacher and a Black woman who runs the kitchen. On the surface of it all, this looks to be a terrible combination, but as the movie plays out, more and more is revealed. The movie is plot-heavy and I shan't say another word on that. Paul Giamatti, a regular of Payne's prior movie work, brings what I feel is one of his strongest movie roles ever. Da'Vine Joy Randolph is outstanding as the Black kitchen supervisor with a heavy heart. Dominic Sessa is frankly too old (33 in real life) to play the rebellious HS student Angus (17 in the movie), I mean, it's really really obvious. That said, Payne just hits all the right notes in this film, and this resonated with me on so many levels. Despite the serious undertones, there are quite a few funny moments in the movie as well.""The Holdovers"" premiered a few months ago at the Telluride film festival to immediate and widespread critical acclaim. There is good reason why this is currently rated 87% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. The movie opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati the weekend before last. The early Sunday evening screening where I saw this at was attended so-so (about 12-15 people). If you are in the mood for a top-notch comedy drama, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion."
"The Holdovers","imseeg","14 December 2023",610,"I am big fan of director Alexander Payne (The Descendants, Sideways) and of actor Paul Giamatti in particular. Both have teamed up before with marvellous results, but this movie has got 1 problem that made me only rate it with 6 stars though:The bad:the middle part of this story stretches out too long, with several quite tedious scenes, which could have easily been cut out of it without hurting the storyline. I started watching at my watch half way through several times because of this lack of spark and punch. Such a pity!Fortunately this movie picked up momentum again towards the warmhearted Christmas spirited final, but I still will only award this movie with 6 stars (instead of 7) because I got bored at many moments during the somewhat tedious and long middle part.The story: It's about a young student and his teacher, who both are lonely souls and although they cant stand each other at first, eventually slowly do bond with each other during a Christmas holiday. Acting by Paul Giamatti is masterful (as always), BUT some of the other actors fail to impress me.Not the best of director Alexander Payne's work, but definitely still worth a watch, because it left me in my seat with a smile on my face and a feel good Christmas spirit of caring for one another!"

If this film doesn't make you feel sone kind of emotion, you are absolutely heartless. You love these characters. You feel for them on every single level. The film itself feels like a film from the 70s. The twists and turns the film takes are wonderful and heartwarming/heartbreaking. Paul Giamatti is excellent as always. This is Dominic Sessa's first film and he does an outstanding job. No crazy special effects or bloated explosions. Just great filmmaking. It's streaming on Peacock. An absolute holiday must. Take the time to watch it. You'll love it."
"The Holdovers","arfdawg-1","26 December 2023",510,"Lots of great reviews here. Many people who have seen Sideways seem to be excited that Giamatti has re-teamed with Payne the director.Of course, the film is in no way related to the other movie, except that both were involved and that Sideways has quite a cult following.Unfortunately this is not my type of movie. I'm not saying it's bad. And I'm not saying anything bad about the people who seem to love it. It's just not for me.It's a character driven movie, which is fine, except I didnt bond with any of the characters. And I found the choice of musical tunes throughout to be annoying at best.So if you like drawn out period piece character driven flicks, you may like this one. I didn't love it, but I could see how some might, hence the ""5"" rating."
"The Holdovers","kevin_robbins","31 December 2023",910,"My wife and I watched The Holdovers (2023) on Peacock last night. The storyline unfolds at a boarding school in Massachusetts during holiday vacation, focusing on the kids with nowhere to go for the holidays and the staff assigned to care for them, who happen to be facing a similar issue. Together, they work to uncover inner demons and find a way to release them, allowing everyone to truly enjoy the holiday season.Directed by Alexander Payne (Sideways), the film stars Paul Giamatti (American Splendor), Da'Vine Joy Randolph (Dolemite is my Name), Dominic Sessa, and Carrie Preston (Claws).This is an exceptionally unique holiday film, offering intriguing settings, characters, and circumstances. All facets are fascinating and worthwhile, with outstanding writing that establishes the storyline and various subplots effectively. The dialogue is absolutely superb, featuring a well-balanced blend of raw emotion, character development, and comedy. The eyebrow-raising conclusion is perfect for the characters' concluding direction.In conclusion, The Holdovers is a unique and captivating character piece that's an absolute must-see. I would score this a 9/10 and strongly recommend it."
"The Holdovers","euroGary","19 October 2023",1010,"One does not expect a Christmas film to be challenging, and this one certainly isn't. But it is a lot of fun.A boys' boarding school empties of almost all staff and pupils for the 1970/1 Festive Season. Left behind are Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti), the unpopular history teacher who has to keep an eye on the school; Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa), a teenaged pupil whose mother does not want him on her honeymoon; and Mary Lamb (the impressively-named Da'Vine Joy Randolph), the school cook who is facing her first Christmas alone since her son died on military service. As these three lonely souls come together, there are tantrums, emotional revelations, the revealing of long-hidden secrets, a noble sacrifice... the usual stuff.Also the usual stuff are the characters: Paul is cynical and frustrated; Angus is ironic and insecure; and as Mary is overweight and black, she of course has to be sassy.But while in some films such predictability would be annoying, it works here. Within the limits of their somewhat two-dimensional personalities, the characters are well-written - even Angus' tantrums do not seem unreasonable. Plus, there are some great gags (""You hit him? You mean you punched him out?"" ""No, I hit him with a car..."") And I will not be the only viewer who finishes the film with a lump in his throat.Great fun. I can easily see myself buying the DVD and watching this for many Christmases to come..."
"The Holdovers","cherold","31 December 2023",810,"This movie is about a handful of entitled boys who regretfully must stay behind during the Christmas break at their private school and the teacher and cook there to oversee them.It's a funny and affecting movie with excellent performances from the leads, especially Paul giamatti as the prickly teacher.It's a Christmas movie of sorts, since it does take place at Christmas, but it's really more of an anytime of the year film in which you get to see people have adventures and fight and grow and that sort of thing.It's very well filmed, it's very entertaining, and I would recommend you watch it."
"The Holdovers","bastille-852-731547","29 October 2023",610,"Set in December 1970, ""The Holdovers"" follows a small group of students who have to stay on campus over the Christmas break at Barton Academy (a prestigious boarding school in Massachusetts,) alongside a curmudgeonly ancient history teacher (Paul Giamatti.) That sounds like a potentially amusing premise for a breezy comedy-drama, especially when Alexander Payne is directing. Having greatly enjoyed and admired several of Payne's previous films such as ""Sideways,"" ""The Descendants,"" and ""Nebraska,"" I was looking forward to this film. Overall, I found it to be simply fine and not up to par with the level of quality of most of Payne's films. There's nothing too wrong with it by any stretch of the imagination, but it's often generic and forgettable compared to Payne's other films.An indie dramedy like this film would generally be expected to be defined by being character- and writing-driven. Unfortunately, neither the characters nor the writing here are especially unique enough to structure a compelling plot around. Paul (Giamatti's character) is very generic, as is the rebellious student Angus, whose relationship with Paul is a pivotal part of the film. On a better note, Da'Vine Joy Randolph gives a strong and impactful performance as Mary, a cafeteria worker dealing with bereavement; her character is interestingly more dynamic and multi-dimensional than either Paul or Angus. The writing and humor is less unique, funny, or engaging than many of Payne's films, as the attempts at plot devices, character development, and humor often boil down to insult comedy between Paul and Angus--which, ultimately, wears out its welcome a bit, and actually causes a bit of collateral damage in making the film's tone and story feel less sincere. Regardless of the sincerity of the story, another thing that is clear here is that there needed to be a stronger and less predictable core to the plot in order for the film to remain engaging for its 133-minute runtime.The film's retro, 1970s-aesthetic is commendable and helps contribute to the atmosphere of the film, and there still are some sporadic sweet moments of Paul and Mary hanging out around the television and a few decent jokes here and there. So ""The Holdovers"" is a fine enough film, but it won't be a new holiday classic for me. 6/10."
"The Holdovers","RahulM007","31 October 2023",1010,"""Penis cancer in human form.""Alexander Payne's ""The Holdovers"" is a laugh-out-loud comedy strengthened by Paul Giamatti and Dominic Sessa's magnetic performances and their incredible chemistry together. I am in awe by the film's brilliant and inventive screenplay, 70s-style cinematography, slick editing, and great production design. I could watch Paul and Angus bicker for another two hours. Throughout the film, the humour gets more interwoven leading to a crescendo of hilarity. ""The Holdovers"" offers the perfect blend of humor and pathos.*That waitress was so rude for refusing to accept their order of cherries jubilee. She is a fascist and a ""penis cancer in human form"".*The film reminded me of Peter Weir's ""Dead Poets Society"", Milos Forman's ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", and John Hughes' ""The Breakfast Club"" (kind of).Final verdict: 10/10."
"The Holdovers","Avwillfan89","29 November 2023",910,"Finally, Alexander Payne has made a worthy follow up to his (in my opinion at least) masterpiece Sideways.I really related so much to all three of the main characters, who all come from different backgrounds. Paul Giamatti, brilliant in almost anything he does, plays a grumpy, alcoholic, sour professor who does not suffer fools and doesn't cut his privileged students any slack. Dominic Sessa is troubled teen with a dysfunctional family and mental issues. D'Avine Joy Randolf is a grieving mother stuck in a job wanting to make ends meet for her family, by her choice.This movie has great character development, a wholesome story with flawed yet lovable characters you can root for and terrific, funny dialogue. Simple, yet perfect. 9 out of 10."
"The Holdovers","frankde-jong","27 December 2023",910,"I had a lot of associations when I started watching ""The holdovers"".Kids stuck in a school during the Christmas vacation, is that not a little bit like ""The breakfast club"" (1985, John Hughes)? No, because most of the kids go away early in the film and we are left with just one pupil (Angus Tully played by Dominic Sessa) and a teacher (Paul Hunham played by Paul Giamatti).Paul Hunham teaches ancient languages and culture. Does that sounds like the Donna Tartt novel ""The secret history"" (1992)? No, in that novel the pupils are inspired by their teacher. In ""The holdovers"" the teacher is hated.One association that I did not have at all prior to watching the movie may be the most accurate: ""Scent of a woman"" (1992, Martin Brest). Also in this film a high school pupil on an expensive boarding school and a grumpy old man are condemned to each other.Best of all however we can see ""The holdovers"" as the comeback of Alexander Payne after his failed film ""Downsizing"" (2017). The film is situated in 1970 and has a very 70's look and feel, down to the aspect ratio then used. The film also contains very beautiful images of Norteast American landscapes.First of all however the film is about its three main characters. Apart from the two already introduced we have the chief cook of the boarding school Mary Lamb (Da'Vine Joy Randolph). These three people form a sort of substitute family that has to spend the Christmas season together. Each of them has his/her problems but during the film they grow closer to each other, or at least learn to understand each other better.Being a Christmas movie you expect a happy ending and somewhere in the middle of the film this happy ending seems to consist of all the members of the proxy family being on their way towards an unexpected romance. The greatness of the film is that these romances do not materialize fully. The message of the film seems to be that gaining better understanding is a happy enough ending.By the way the film does not shy away from some social criticism. The character of Paul Hunham is meant to be grumpy at first, but to me he was instantly sympathetic when he made the headmaster of the boarding school very clear that in his class wealthy parents could not buy good grades for their sons. Later he says to his pupils (at that stage of the film there are still a couple of them) that they ought to be aware of their privileged status. ""You go to Harvard, poorer boys go to Vietnam"". The Vietnam war plays an important role in the background anyway. The son of the chief cook has died in Vietnam and while visiting a bar in the village nearby the boarding school there is a local boy that lost one of his hands in Vietnam.All in all ""The holdovers"" is a very convincing comeback of Alexander Payne. He made an instant Christmas classic!"
"The Holdovers","210west","14 January 2024",410,"Alexander Payne's 1999 comedy ""Election,"" set in a Midwestern high school, was brilliant, sometimes painful, sometimes hilarious. Best of all (I say this as a onetime high school teacher), it felt refreshingly authentic.""The Holdovers"" is quite the opposite: contrived, predictable, and intended to teach -- you guessed it -- a little lesson in compassion. An hour into it, I realized that it hadn't yet contained a single moment that seemed genuine, much less surprising. Every line of dialogue sounds phony. Characters speak in little announcements, spelling things out for us. Some of the characters -- a couple of menacing townies, for example -- are mere cartoons.Giamatti's protagonist is a wholly artificial creation, designed as if in a screenwriting course to follow the approved character arc -- initially stuffy and unsympathetic to the point of caricature, ultimately vulnerable. Ironically, an early scene between him and the school's headmaster violates what's sometimes regarded as a screenwriting rule: Do NOT, even in the interest of exposition, have people telling each other what they already know. (The by-the-numbers triteness of that conversation -- meant to show us that the instructor is uncompromising and pedantic but possesses old-fashioned integrity, blah blah blah -- put me off from the start.) The scenes between Giamatti and the school's cook -- in which, with the audience in mind, the two provide personal backstories and reveal their inner selves -- are painfully heavy-handed and at times so gooey that I felt sorry for the actress: ""You can't even dream a whole dream, can you?"" she is made to say at one point. ""What are you afraid of?""Yes, I know, everybody seems to love the movie. I could barely stomach it. But do check out ""Election."""
"The Holdovers","bdesdes","30 October 2023",810,"Very enjoyable film with outstanding performances and a wonderful warm vibe accompanied by the Christmas season. It's funny at times, sad at times, and feel-good. It's a story that almost all can relate to and will really touch your heart. It deals with so many themes, but mainly grief, the past, family, and what makes a person who they are. It's also very original and has a great script, cinematography, and soundtrack. I would highly advise to see it in the theaters as well as you really get the 70's vibe and deep moment on the big screen. There aren't many negatives to this film and I would recommend it to most people."
