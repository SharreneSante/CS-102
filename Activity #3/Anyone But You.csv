"Anyone But You","barbett-1","1 January 2024",510,"Neither brilliant nor dreadful, ""Anyone But You"" features a cast of characters that are unbelievably attractive and, apparently, insanely wealthy. It stars Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeny's breasts in the formulatic equivalent of a Hallmark Movie knock-off. You know the drill - two perfect young people meet, are instantly attracted to each other, are separated by a misunderstanding with hilarious hijinks ensuing. The misunderstanding is eventually resolved, love blooms once more, and all ends well.What sets this film apart is excellent cinematography with lovely wide-angle views of the Australian countryside. The supporting cast is very capable although the Australian men are played as oafish stereotypes. Glen Powell plays his part well, but Sydney Sweeny appears to be reading her lines from a teleprompter offscreen. Not the worst movie out this holiday season and enjoyable as long as you refrain from high expectations."
"Anyone But You","pkertes-59666","5 January 2024",410,"I went to see this movie because I am a sucker for a romantic comedy, even the average ones (and let's face it, most of them are). Having seen the trailer, I had low expectations, yet this film still managed to come it at an even lower level.Boy meets girl, they hit it off briefly, there is a misunderstanding and when they reconnect through a friend/family wedding, they hate each other. Except as anyone could predict, ultimately they don't really, but it takes an eternity of inauthentic, puerile dross to get there. No tissues needed here.The acting is generally average to poor, and local actors like Rachel Griffiths and Bryan Brown (much of it filmed in Australia) do the minimum required, and are completely wasted here. The script is juvenile, facile and has little in common with reality. The direction is pedestrian and much of the movie is a travel ad for Sydney. Throw in plastic, unlikeable characters and a healthy dose of gratuitous nudity. The attempts at comedy are almost laughable as that, and what little romance eventuates at the end fails to convince after nearly two hours of tripe beforehand.Not recommended, even if you are a fan of the genre."
"Anyone But You","trinaboice","8 January 2024",410,"IN A NUTSHELL:
After an amazing first date, Bea and Ben's fiery attraction turns ice-cold until they find themselves unexpectedly reunited at a destination wedding in Australia that their exes also attend. So, they do what any two mature adults would do: pretend to be a couple amidst the fighting.The film was directed by Will Gluck, who also wrote it with Ilana Wolpert.Ultimately, this is like a rated R Hallmark movie with lots of raunch.THINGS I LIKED:
There is plenty of eye candy here for everyone. The cast is filled with good-looking people and includes Sydney Sweeney, Glen Powell, Alexandra Shipp, Hadley Robinson, GaTa, Michelle Hurd, Dermot Mulroney, Rachel Griffiths, Bryan Brown, and more.Sydney Sweeney was bit by a spider in the movie while filming. That famous clip was posted online and got a lot of stir.We get to visit Australia during the film.The cast is diverse, offering a variety of stories about romance and love.The last scene takes clips from the whole movie and has all of the actors sing the same song for a feel-good moment.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Sure, everyone in the cast is hot, but the script is garbage. It sounded like it was written by a trashy version of Chat GPT.It's supposed to be funny, but it's pathetic how they are instantly super ugly and mean-spirited to each other when they have a miscommunication.It's SUPER predictable.Cliched end-of-movie singing, dancing scene.So much fighting.So many awkward moments.They say the movie is loosely based on Shakepeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"", but I think the Bard would be disgusted by the lack of intelligent language in the script. So many F-bombs. One similarity is that they get a wedding cake from a shop called ""Dogberry's"", which is the name of a character in the play.I cringed and rolled my eyes so many times.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
This movie is definitely not appropriate for kids. It portrays unhealthy relationships and extremely bad behavior.Kids will be completely bored because it's mostly adults talking to each other.Profanity and lots of F-bombs
A lesbian couple kisses and gets married
We see a topless woman
We see several shirtless men
A couple gropes each other inside their shorts.Two women wear bikini tops that barely cover anything.We see a ton of cleavage
A lot of sexual innuendo. We see an unmarried couple in the shower and bed together.We see two men smoke a joint.!"
"Anyone But You","ambusched94","31 December 2023",210,"A forgettable, expendable rom-com where all the somewhat funny, shock value scenes are exposed in the theatrical trailer and there is hardly any laugh-out-loud scenes in this film overall.While Glen Powell has the comedy chops and romantic charm for this film genre, to my astonishment it's the EXACT OPPOSITE for Sydney Sweeney. Her line delivery is dull and she has the same facial expressions, blank stare, dead eyes for most scenes in Anyone But You. You can tell she's acting as in she's not embodying the character in the story and she's simply reading the lines, not conveying any natural nuances in her character each time she does this. Sweeney's crying scene in the taxi felt unnaturally forced. I was surprised her acting was half-a**ed, whereas in the TV series Euphoria (2019-present) her acting feels natural. Or highly likely that she's a limited-range, one-note actress that can only do dark, coming-of-age drama genre and fails at rom-com. IMO, Powell and Sweeney had the most chemistry when their characters were arguing and hating each other. When they got all lovey dovey, the on-screen chemistry felt forced and it was lacking that romantic spark between their characters. I was not invested enough in their progressing relationship to care once they officially got together in the end.So one, I feel like Sweeney largely ruins the film with her bland acting and line delivery, and lack of emotiveness. A better choice for the lead actress in this film should've been a comedic actress or an actress who can deftly juggle comedic timing and dramatic, emotional scenes. If this film was made and released in the 2000s decade for example, Amanda Bynes would be a prime choice for the role of Bea. And two, the character development is lacking and backstory are just tacked-on but don't add any characterization substance. The screenplay pushes the two characters to meet instantaneously at the start of the film, so viewers don't get any individual scenes of each lead character beforehand leaving a lot of character backstory nonexistent. The screenplay gives a brief overlay of each of Ben's and Bea's backstory in a scene montage and it's the error of telling over showing, and it doesn't work, leaving a rushed characterization of both characters that cheapens the film.Supporting characters feel like caricatures and don't add anything to the story. No supporting character was memorable. Some corny dialogue and meta rom-com instances that seem shoehorned in. Also, I wish Darren Barnet (Paxton from the TV series Never Have I Ever (2020-2023)) had more scenes, dialogue and that he would've been the guy Bea ended up with if there was an unexpected surprise, twist ending, instead of the ""enemies to lovers"" and ""stuck together so they'll end up together"" overused romance tropes. But the screenplay is too safe and screenwriters would never be bold enough to rise up to a different, atypical ending like this.I did like that the majority of the film was set in Australia and a few of the songs used in the film's soundtrack.It's ironic that Dermot Mulroney and Rachel Griffiths are in this sucky rom-com when blasting back to the past to 1997, both Mulroney (as the leading man and love interest) and Griffiths (in a supporting role) starred in a first rate quality rom-com, My Best Friend's Wedding. This is why most of my fave rom-coms are from the '90s and the 2000s. When quality storytelling, chemistry, and character development reigned in comparison to this current rom-com garbage.Anyone But You is a derivative, formulaic rom-com that's ultimately unmemorable, vapid rom-com plot, and a waste of time. Just casually watch it once it comes out on streaming if you have nothing else to watch and don't care about draining 1 hour 43 minutes of your time."
"Anyone But You","dogonlion","10 February 2024",110,"Everything in this movie feels forced. The comedy is like ""please laugh, please laugh"". I guess that works on some. Nothing flows naturally. The way they love at first sight and all of the sudden start bickering is unrealistic. The bickering is annoying. Sydney Sweeney is a really good actress, I really liked her in The White Lotus, but she's hasn't been in a movie that uses her full potential yet. The movie is full of cliches. It even has the funny black friend with no love life. I'm really shocked by how much money this movie made. I guess as long as those kinds of movies make money they'll keep the same formula and keep factory produce them and soon will use artificial intelligence to write them."
"Anyone But You","miza004","22 December 2023",510,"This movie is exactly what I thought it would be so I can't complain too much.The two leads are both very attractive and have good chemistry, so that was entertaining to watch and nice on the eyes. It had some cute scenes. I gotta say the ensemble was pretty good if I laughed it was always because something one of them said. They were a bunch of goofy characters. I also enjoyed dermot mulroney's character when he was learning how to dive and the reoccurance of that at the end of the movie. It made me giggle.But I gotta say... the dialogue was very mediocre and at times just not good at all. It just lacked depth which again didn't expect it to have depth but still could have been better."
"Anyone But You","chris_rowe-881-168820","14 January 2024",210,"Why do we need pretty people clearly in make up (men and women) throughout, even in situations everyone would look rough in they're still perfect, it's boring, dated and lazy.Shocker, gay wedding and interracial family, I'm someone who never noticed before but this generations desperation to force things into films now is a bit embarrassing and point scoring.Fake white teeth.Lead girl can't act and has horrific voice, she failed so badly with dialogue, but I guess that's why you made sure some of her assets were visible at every moment! I'm sure her sister really wanted to see through her top!Writing was desperate and ripped off many 90s films, but failed to deliver a script of set of people that seemed real.Why are the actors so unlikeable ?Why is it ok for that guyto keep saying ""white boy things"" as an insult? When if Ben said black guy stuff this film would be cancelled.I'd put good money on SS not being cast if not for two reasons.Why can't films have a bit steamier love scenes? Why is it all so pg!"
"Anyone But You","cinemapersonified","22 December 2023",410,"Rating: 4.4
Overall, an incredibly formulaic Rom-Com that tries way too hard to capitalize on the popularity and looks of Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney, but fails hard as it is so predictable and barely funny.Bad Direction (The whole movie just feels like the studio shelled out something to tick boxes rather than make a well thought-out comedy (this included plot concepts, wardrobing, and jokes) because that's what they think the audience 'wants' as they try too hard to be 'modern,' meaning the director couldn't make any creative decisions; the direction on both a macro and microscale feels very formulaic to other Rom-Coms; the direction of actors is very bad as he does not establish any chemistry for the cast as all the performances feel mundane and toneless; the storytelling is a formulaic and predictable Rom-Com), Bad Acting (Bad to Pretty Bad from Sydney Sweeney (The overall performance feels mundane and toneless and she fails to establish any chemistry with Glen Powell, but she does have some moments where she does a decent to pretty good job), Decent to Pretty Good from Glen Powell (The only positive performance in the movie as he holds his own and leads the movie well as a Rom-Com lead (it's just the material is so bad he can only do so much)), Decent from Alexandra Shipp (Actually holds her own well and shows some a little range (which is a lot given this movie)), Bad from GaTa (Cannot match the levels of any of the other actors and feels very toneless with little effort), Pretty Bad from Hadley Robinson (Just doesn't offer anything), Decent from Michelle Hurd (Shows some experience and decent timing), Decent from Dermot Mulroney (Has some charisma and timing), Decent from Charlee Fraser (The most surprising performance of the movie as she holds her own fairly well and establishes some charm and chemistry with Glen Powell), Very Bad from the rest of the cast (Just a lot of toneless and stereotypical Rom-Com performances; there is no chemistry in the entire cast)), Very Bad Story (The concept is a modern retelling of Shakespeare's 'Much Ado About Nothing,' but it does not do anything to be unique as it just follows the cookie cutter Rom-Com plot (mixed with forced modern references); the story construction is incredibly formulaic as each scene is incredibly predictable on what is going to happen and where it is going to go; because the movie is so predictable, there is a flow because it just follows this boilerplate to a tea; the character writing is terrible as all the characters as so shallow and stereotypical to Rom-Coms (and things are brought up for characters that never get addressed or add more depth to the characters)), Very Bad Screenplay (The dialogue is atrocious and very predictable (the movie forces in so many modern references that it just feels like they are pandering to the youth rather than writing realistic dialogue); the joke hit rate is probably 1 out of every 5 jokes (and some of the jokes are just so stupid that its cringe at how they even made this movie); the symbolism is incredibly overt (with the quotes from the source material and the messages of the story being overlaid onto the screen); the foreshadowing is incredibly overt that it makes the movie incredibly predictable), Decent Score; Decent Soundtrack (Did enjoy the songs they chose), Pretty Good Cinematography (Very polished as you could tell the studio put in a lot of money to make this movie), Pretty Bad Sound (Some of the sound effects are just off from what happened), Decent Editing (The actual edit was very polished and felt like it had a big budget; the cut for the movie just feels weird as it is obvious where they did reshoots and what was originally shot), Good Costumes (They made a very conscious decision with what each character was wearing to get people to watch this movie (and I respect that)), Plot Structure followed the source material's and Rom-Com template to a tee (which made the movie incredibly formulaic and predictable), Pacing was decent (as it kept the Rom-Com pace), Climax was so forced and incredibly formulaic (which made me cringe very hard when watching this movie), Tone was very similar to other Rom-Coms (especially from the early 2010s), It was so obvious where there were reshoots for this movie as some of the scenes were so bad and some were more tolerable."
"Anyone But You","masonsaul","30 December 2023",710,"Anyone But You is an enjoyably cynical rom com that still has plenty of heartfelt romance at its centre. Just getting one of these theatrically released currently is kind of a miracle and it plays squarely to the genre's strengths. All its beats are predictable in the best way.Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell are on their way to becoming genuine movie stars and this film only further solidifies that. The constant barbs they send each other's way for the majority of the film are really funny and the chemistry they're constantly trying to deny has a real spark to it.This isn't Will Gluck's first rom com and that's apparent in the good ways. The broad physical comedy is balanced nicely by the snappy wit interspersed throughout and it's surprisingly epic (a lot more helicopter stuff than expected). A good soundtrack always helps with this genre and the one here nails it."
"Anyone But You","Remmuchan","27 December 2023",310,"I cannot for the life of me understand how this ended up being a movie shown in theaters. I went into this having no idea what the movie was about. I can now say that I wish I never even bothered to purchase a ticket to see this atrocity. It was the biggest waste of my time ever.I cannot tell you how many times I cringed watching this and how many times I wanted it to just end. The acting was AWFUL, especially from the lead actress who tried so hard to act seductive but it just came off as terrible. Everything about this movie made no sense. The plot line was awful. It felt like watching a really cheesy Netflix rom-com but a hundred times worse. The shocking nude scenes just added to its awfulness.I can't get over how bad this is and I really think they just wanted to make something to tick all the boxes of what a rom-com is except it did not tick any of those boxes at all. Terrible acting, terrible movie, terrible plot line, terrible directing, terrible EVERYTHING.I HATED this movie. Avoid at all costs."
"Anyone But You","MichaelByTheSea","26 December 2023",910,"This was like an R rated raunchy Hallmark movie where people actually have sex. I can do without the miscommunication trope that drove apart a couple that seemed to be connecting, but I enjoyed the banter and really enjoyed the stars.""Serious"" critics typically don't appreciate the rom-com genre and judge them harshly. I went with my adult children and we all loved the movie. My kids make fun of my love for Hallmark movies, but even they liked this one. We laughed out loud repeatedly and walked out smiling. I love that feeling.Sure, the script is flawed, the plot's ridiculous, and some of the dialogue is a bit off, but Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney light up the screen with their amazing chemistry. They're extraordinary specimens and look like they spend 6 hours a day in the gym, but I also like them as actors. Glen Powell was really good in another enjoyable modern rom-com with Zoey Deutch called ""Set It Up"" and he's fearless here, especially with the over the top body humor.Sydney Sweeney is certainly voluptuous, and gorgeous to look at, but she's also established herself as a great actress in more critic friendly shows like ""Euphoria"" and ""White Lotus"". Edgy and dark is fine, and it certainly gets taken more seriously by the critics, but I prefer getting lost in an escapist rom-com that doesn't involve terrible people doing terrible things.I want more of this."
"Anyone But You","Iwona2403","8 February 2024",710,"Finally a romantic comedy that feels like something from late 90s, early 00's.Dig this so much!!These movies are not Oscar material nor were they intended to be. But they are heartwarming and cute!Teens should have more movies like this!Us adults, we're craving for good old style romantic comedies.I hope Hollywood will keep making more and more of these!The chemistry was very good between main characters! The colors of the movie... The vibe throughout entire movie! I enjoyed it.It's a seven from me cause I desperately need more movies like this.Thank you creators for finally making us happy! 😊"
"Anyone But You","NatKaminska","28 December 2023",110,"I need to warn those of you who want to spend your money on this thing: don't do it, not worth it. I watched the movie and it was horrible. It tried to be a charming '90s and '2000s rom-com, yet it failed in every department except with the male lead. Glen Powell is the only good thing about this movie.'Anyone but you' is full of cliches and while you can do cliches in a good way, and make genuine, great gem of a specific genre, this is not the case here. The movie is boring, shallow, cringe comedy with typical cringe, over-the-top, not-funny jokes, maybe 1 joke lands in the entire movie, that's how bad it is. The supposedly 'hilarious' nude scene on the cliff, especially the part when Powell is bending over, completely naked, holding his balls in his hands, is the next level of cringe, nothing funny, nothing charming, just cringe, awkward, awful. It's also full of heavy, not subtle, and obvious cultural references as if the writers just wrote down popular internet memes. Man, these writers really don't have any respect for the viewers. I basically wanted to walk out of this movie after the first 15 minutes.The romance part is badly done as well. The chemistry is average at best, just like a normal chemistry between two beautiful people - they are easy on the eyes oh right, like most people in this industry, but nothing more. They are not Mulder and Scully or Hanks and Ryan. Another problem with the main couple is that only Powell is to some degree likable, even tho the script doesn't make his character particularly likable, Powell's natural charisma and charm do the trick. With Sweeney that doesn't exist, she is utterly unlikeable as Bea, and this flaw kills the romance and fun completely. Despite what was said about this duo during the last summer and what some of their blind stans and the media still say now, they don't fit together as a rom-com couple at all!The screenplay itself doesn't help the actors achieve any chemistry, as the entire story is incredibly predictable, and thus boring, with awful dialogues and wooden acting most of the time.Nothing really happens in this movie! Any romantic comedy has to have some stakes in the relationship, some solid drama, and funny, unexpected twists and turns that make sense at least in the fictional universe. In this movie, the conflict that starts Ben and Bea's feud doesn't even make sense! Literally, one minute of simple explanation would clear the air between them, as they are visibly attracted to each other, from the first moment they meet. So the whole basis of this film, that they hate each other, doesn't make sense. We needed some stronger reason for the hate here.Yes, I'm aware that this movie is based on Shakespeare's play 'Much Ado About Nothing', and that one point of that play is that a great fuss/drama between the protagonists started from something insignificant ('nothing'), but every artist, and not only an artist but average person, knows that film is a completely different medium than a theater play, and what worked in a play about romance, written in Shakespeare's times, doesn't work as well in a modern, romantic comedy film. This movie isn't written intelligently enough to make it work either. Again, for the plot to be compelling in this film, we needed a stronger reason for hatred between the main characters, and the development of the characters, and we got neither of those things. Throughout the film, the characters are basic sketches, and we don't know much about them till the end.Then, during the next two, remaining acts of the movie, also nothing really happens. They decide to fake that they are together out of the blue, and their reasons for it are also simply not good enough for the audience to care about the characters and the story. Throughout the entire film, we don't see at all that Ben genuinely desires his ex, and Bea's parents don't have enough of the presence, are completely flat, insignificant characters for the audience to believe or care that she needs to lie to them, which were the two main reasons for the masquerade. Therefore, another giant flaw of the script: the motivations of the main characters that are supposed to push the plot forward are insufficient to be credible and interesting to the audience.In general, the problem is that nothing is fleshed out in 'Anyone but You' - not the main storyline, not the two main leads, not the background characters, drama, or comedy.The 'meta' lines in the script, the kinda 'wink- wink we know it's typical rom-com trope' also don't work because for this to work, the entire script would have to be much more intelligent and satirical, and it isn't smart or a satire at all! It just tried to cheat the audience by doing this, or the writers gave themselves an easy excuse for the rest of their bad writing, and again - it doesn't work. Nothing works in this movie.Yet another big problem: Sydney doesn't have a talent for comedy, sorry. Her delivery is very bland and too stiff, her character is flat, like cut out of a cardboard figure. I just don't understand how someone like her could get the role specifically in romantic comedy if she doesn't fit this role at all. Weren't there some other, better, and actually comedy-talented, cute actresses available during the casting process? Or was it just an easy money grab because it is Sydney Sweeney from 'Euphoria'?Glen is the only one who can be genuinely hilarious and gives his all, and that is not a surprise for anyone who follows his career. Glen already showed his comedy talent in Scream Queens but also proved it as Hangman in Top Gun. He is a very funny guy in real life too, as you can see in his interviews, so it's obvious comedy is natural for him. That's why he absolutely is in his element in this movie, and he 'feels it' but the problem is no one of the rest of the cast is, including Sydney. And Glen alone is still not good enough to save this movie.When you have such a difference in comedic chops between two leads in a romantic comedy that is a giant problem. I don't know if you noticed, but the hilarious thing is, you can already see in the trailers, that Sydney is not good at all in this movie. I remember that I commented her delivery is terrible the minute I watched the trailer!After I watched this movie, I definitely think Glen is much better in romantic comedies when paired with Zoey Deutch. Glen has a way better, more organic, and natural chemistry with Zoey than with Sydney, maybe because Zoey has a comedy talent just like Glen. I saw on Glen's IMDB that he is going to star in another comedy with Zoey, hopefully, better written than this one, so I will wait for it.To sum up, 'Anyone but You' is not worth one second of your time, your money, or any buzz, just wait for the the movie to appear on the streaming platforms. It doesn't have the great main couple, it doesn't have good background characters, it doesn't have the charm, wit, and natural flow that romantic comedies of the '90s or early '2000 had, like She's All That, Love Actually, Holiday, 10 Things I Hate About You, or How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.It simply doesn't have good or even decent writing! And I'm not the enemy of romantic comedies, I'm a woman and aspiring filmmaker, I love great romantic comedies just like any other great movie, of any other genre. But this movie is so bad, that I genuinely felt ashamed while watching it - I felt ashamed for the filmmakers who made this, especially the writers. Don't bother!"
"Anyone But You","SnoopyStyle","24 February 2024",610,"Bea (Sydney Sweeney) meets Ben (Glen Powell) in a coffee shop and they hook up. There are misunderstandings next morning and they leave angry. It turns out that his friend is marrying her sister. The two enemies have to attend a destination wedding in Australia.Sweeney and Powell are trying all kind of broad physical humor. They are both gorgeous and both have good charisma. Neither are outright comedians and that is important. They are mildly funny but are rarely the funniest part. The first big laugh is the WTF old guy while the two bicker. The butt grabbing scene kinda works, but the leads may be overshadowed by a koala. This duo tries very hard. It's so ridiculous that it's mildly funny."
"Anyone But You","johnnymonsarrat","3 February 2024",410,"Hello again, fellow film travelers.I have to wonder what happened to the writing of this movie. There are some interesting and touching twists to the plot. But mainly it seems plot driven, not character driven. Characters don't make consistent choices with their personality or logic, for example what happens with the parents at the end.The male lead has an acting style that's full of confidence, but he's supposed to be a comic figure that has disabling phobias. God knows why he can barely swim but he can teach diving.The female lead, I take no pleasure in saying this, tends to speak at the other actors instead of to them.I get that the writers were trying to go for a Shakespeare type of thing, like Much Ado About Nothing, but the movie simply wasn't comedic enough to have unconvincing character choices. You can get away with a lot of goofy stuff in a slapstick comedy. But this had mostly drama. So the characters need to make sense.I am sorry. I really wanted to like this.There were hints of genius. There was some good physical comedy and a few touchimg moments. But the cringe worthy flaws buried them."
"Anyone But You","gerrgrady-86307","27 December 2023",210,"My husband and I chose this movie as a Saturday treat. We left around the halfway mark because I kept hoping that it would improve - a waste of time & our weekly movie budget. The actors were given dialog that was juvenile and scene set-ups that were embarrassing. Lots of gratitious nudity and shots of partial nudity. Anyone interested in seeing this movie should just watch the trailer - it gives viewers a good picture of what they'll see at the theater so they don't waste their time sitting through a really bad movie. It was great seeing Bryan Brown but I wish he had chosen a better vehicle in which to appear than this dreck. I had greater expections for Glen Powell, but then maybe this is the level of his actual talent. Sad."
"Anyone But You","DeanAmythe","4 January 2024",410,"Never been into romcoms all that much (I watch movies alone all day as a true cinglephile), though I acknowledge their importance in filling the void for comfort watches: predictable, feel-good, and just the right amount of schmaltz - perfect for a night out (or in). Their template structure isn't so much a concern rather than an obstacle to overcome, which can be achieved with a fun gimmick of some sort, or, simply, by hitting the comedic marks. If this genre wants to see its resurgence these points are vital, and last year's NO HARD FEELINGS was eager to prove that, a return to form yet still raunchy and imbued with a surprising air of maturity - and even when the jokes didn't land, there was still enjoyment to be found in the excellent(ly cast) leads. ANYONE BUT YOU is as back-to-basics as it could get and appears to be, to a certain extent, aware of that, though here the drive to still be its own thing is completely absent. What immediately stands out is the central 'do-they, don't-they', which pretty much feeds directly into the classic plot structure and is barely taken advantage of. When it is being used for comedic purposes, it easily produces the highlights of the film, like the view/spider scene. Most of this, though, is by-the-numbers and safe, lacking any edge or remarkable features aside from the leads' sex appeal (on that front, the quality of the casting is equal to NO HARD FEELINGS). Speaking of them, Powell is as fun as expected - he would most likely be a solid movie star if the current Hollywood system allowed for those - but Sweeney? No clue what she's doing with those line reads, constantly sounding like a bad impression of an American high school girl with a ready disinterest in everything. Not that she has that much to work with anyway, as the script suffers from eye-rollers of jokes, that first half especially bursting with ""did I just say that out loud?"" humor. My sold out screening was awfully silent through most of this, though maybe they were just there for the aforementioned hotties. Just so you know: you don't get a (proper) view of Sweeney's melons, but you do get to see a squeezed Australian glans. 4/10."

I could feel my brain cells dying as I watched this absolute mess of a rom-com.Sydney Sweeney was horrible and has all but ruined her career. She could not make any part of her character believable. Very hard to watch.I'm embarrassed for Brian brown for having anything to do with this movie. He couldn't save this film from disaster.The script jumped all over the place and was so completely unrealistic... not once did the film make me believe any part of it could happen.The film relies on poor humour, And, what they don't show you in the commercials is that it's full of far-left LGBTQ propaganda.I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy."
"Anyone But You","ethanbresnett","6 January 2024",710,"Anyone But You caught me a little bit by surprise I must say. Perhaps that's because my expectations were quite low, but they really needn't have been as this film is a really solid romcom.Primarily this comes from Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney. A romcom lives and dies by its romantic leads, and they are both great in this, nailing the weird and evolving chemistry between their two characters. They are each decently well written, feeling believable and engaging.On top of this, there is a fairly forgettable but perfectly pleasant assortment of supporting characters who add some extra levels of humour to the piece.Speaking of humour, it is a bit hit and miss in this film. There aren't many big laughs, but it is amusing and does have a light and goofy tone throughout that is befitting of any romcom.Now, this film doesn't really reinvent the wheel in any way. It has all the same story beats as most romcoms and doesn't take too many risks. Therefore the plot is fairly mediocre and (as with practically all romcoms) is far too predictable. This never really gets in the way of the fun though, but the inevitable ending does make it feel a teensy bit too long.Overall though I think this is a really solid film. It has a good tone, a couple of engaging leads, and will give you a few laughs too."

My Rating. 6:10Very very loosely based on Shakespeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"" with even a few quotations in the background and title cards this pleasant enough rom com reminds me of a line from a 16 th Century play The Merchant of Venice by same William Shakespeare, ""All that glisters is not gold"".Which of course translates in today's language ""All that glitters is not gold "".Anyone But You has a pleasant cast set in and around Sydney which is fun to spot locations like the QVB building, and our beautiful harbour vistas and pristine beaches.I was reminded of a far superior Classic romantic comedy ""My Best Friend's Wedding "" 1997 when I saw the actor playing the brides father Dermot Mulroney who achieved great success playing a similar lead 26 years ago to Glen Powell who plays Ben the romantic lead man in this movie.I enjoyed both the young leads Sydney Sweeney who plays Bea and Glen Powell who play the star crossed lovers .The differences and similarities for me in great romance comedies with weddings like My Best Friends Wedding and more recently Crazy Rich Asians is obvious they all look fabulous with surroundings that celebrate the affluence of wealthy privileged people .Where they differ from each other is in the quality of the script writing in this case by Ilana Wolpert and Will Gluck.Light comedy can be clever if it's not pretentious why try and improve on Shakespeare? It's an impossible task.Anyone But You is entertaining but parts of it I found really irritating and contrived.Adding a same sex wedding was a nice modern touch but it's the most heterosexual same sex wedding I've ever seen not one Gay in this village except Claudia and Halle the betrothed couple.The most irritating characters for me were the parents of the brides played by Dermot Mulroney, Rachel Griffiths, Bryan Brown and Michelle Hurd they all seemed to be trying to hard .I can't be to critical of this light comedy that probably appeals to a younger audience demographic than myself .I hope it succeeds overseas as we need to export more home grown cinema product from Australia but we can't just rely on great scenery and cute animal platitudes like winking koalas ."
"Anyone But You","psxexperten","9 February 2024",110,"Horrible, don't waste your time
Weak story, unnecessarily extensive vulgar language, and excessive nudity humiliates the actors. Embarrassing movie that degrades men and women and shows no imagination. It is very sad to believe that this movie appeals to people. Downright stupid with no redeeming qualities.I had respect for some of these actors before I watched this movie. All I can say is that perhaps they will do anything for money. I cannot see any other reason to have participated in this film and I am scared for any teenagers or young adults that are entertained by showing off your body and acting like adolescent fools."
"Anyone But You","movieman6-413-929510","5 January 2024",510,"Anyone But You is a new romantic comedy directed, written and produced in part by Will Gluck, director of Easy A and Friends with Benefits.Bea (Sydney Sweeney) and Ben (Glen Powell) haven't seen each other since a first date. When they are both invited to the same wedding, the two meet again.They learn that people are trying to hook them up so they don't cause further problems during the wedding. This is why they pretend, to get rid of the fuss.Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell have good chemistry together in the film and both know how to play well and playfully with and against each other. Despite their chemistry, the overall film is unfortunately more on the standard side of a romantic comedy. This gives the film game its well-known and predictable sides. Other moments come across as a bit too forced. For co-writer Ilana Wolpert, this is only her first written film story.Another downside of the film is the amount of extra characters. Many of these extras bring their own kind of comedy, but otherwise have little real use in the film. With a few fewer of these extras, the film could have been better focused, with a shorter running time."
"Anyone But You","marisol_fc","14 January 2024",110,"What a terrible movie, this reviews have to be fake because there's nothing above 1 star from thia movie.Story is just plain dumb, acting is DEPLORABLE, no wonder they had reshoots, they probably saw the finished product and they said This is beyond bad, and decided if Sydney can't act at least but more boobs and more body asap! Maybe will distract people from her weird acting and that strange way of talking like she has something lodged on her cheeks.Dont waste your money or time in this , go do laundry or try to make that recipe you saved from tik tok.There is a reason they were trying so hard with the promo, EVERYBODY KNEW IT WAS A FLOP."
"Anyone But You","alyetc","28 December 2023",510,"We've seen a million movies set at weddings before - where even the couple getting married gets invested in the main couples status. So I knew a lot of the tropes would be the same, but it was the same but a bit worse. The main couple story I actually really liked, I thought they were hilarious and cute and beat out other movies with the same storyline. It was everything else that fell short. The background characters felt cheesy and fake. All surface level gags or you didn't really get to know them, nothing felt genuine - case in point Bea's parents were incredibly unrealistic, no ones that out of touch. Even Bea's background felt half-done, never explaining why she didn't want law school."
"Anyone But You","STARONTHETOPOFTHESKY","11 February 2024",110,"The movie, unfortunately, failed to deliver on multiple fronts. Its repetitive and cliché romantic comedy storyline lacked originality, leaving the audience unengaged. The attempts at humor fell flat, resulting in a tedious and cringe-worthy viewing experience. To add to the disappointment, the lead actress's annoying voice only added to the overall lackluster quality of the film, making it a forgettable and uninspiring cinematic endeavor. Terrible acting and story. I don't understand the high rating of this movie, or the hype. Save your time and skip this one. The movie is downright horrible, with uncomfortable scenes that make you question their choices. Shame on them for delivering such a poorly written script, leading to an overall disappointing and regrettable cinematic experience."
"Anyone But You","barbett-1","1 January 2024",510,"Neither brilliant nor dreadful, ""Anyone But You"" features a cast of characters that are unbelievably attractive and, apparently, insanely wealthy. It stars Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeny's breasts in the formulatic equivalent of a Hallmark Movie knock-off. You know the drill - two perfect young people meet, are instantly attracted to each other, are separated by a misunderstanding with hilarious hijinks ensuing. The misunderstanding is eventually resolved, love blooms once more, and all ends well.What sets this film apart is excellent cinematography with lovely wide-angle views of the Australian countryside. The supporting cast is very capable although the Australian men are played as oafish stereotypes. Glen Powell plays his part well, but Sydney Sweeny appears to be reading her lines from a teleprompter offscreen. Not the worst movie out this holiday season and enjoyable as long as you refrain from high expectations."
"Anyone But You","pkertes-59666","5 January 2024",410,"I went to see this movie because I am a sucker for a romantic comedy, even the average ones (and let's face it, most of them are). Having seen the trailer, I had low expectations, yet this film still managed to come it at an even lower level.Boy meets girl, they hit it off briefly, there is a misunderstanding and when they reconnect through a friend/family wedding, they hate each other. Except as anyone could predict, ultimately they don't really, but it takes an eternity of inauthentic, puerile dross to get there. No tissues needed here.The acting is generally average to poor, and local actors like Rachel Griffiths and Bryan Brown (much of it filmed in Australia) do the minimum required, and are completely wasted here. The script is juvenile, facile and has little in common with reality. The direction is pedestrian and much of the movie is a travel ad for Sydney. Throw in plastic, unlikeable characters and a healthy dose of gratuitous nudity. The attempts at comedy are almost laughable as that, and what little romance eventuates at the end fails to convince after nearly two hours of tripe beforehand.Not recommended, even if you are a fan of the genre."
"Anyone But You","trinaboice","8 January 2024",410,"IN A NUTSHELL:
After an amazing first date, Bea and Ben's fiery attraction turns ice-cold until they find themselves unexpectedly reunited at a destination wedding in Australia that their exes also attend. So, they do what any two mature adults would do: pretend to be a couple amidst the fighting.The film was directed by Will Gluck, who also wrote it with Ilana Wolpert.Ultimately, this is like a rated R Hallmark movie with lots of raunch.THINGS I LIKED:
There is plenty of eye candy here for everyone. The cast is filled with good-looking people and includes Sydney Sweeney, Glen Powell, Alexandra Shipp, Hadley Robinson, GaTa, Michelle Hurd, Dermot Mulroney, Rachel Griffiths, Bryan Brown, and more.Sydney Sweeney was bit by a spider in the movie while filming. That famous clip was posted online and got a lot of stir.We get to visit Australia during the film.The cast is diverse, offering a variety of stories about romance and love.The last scene takes clips from the whole movie and has all of the actors sing the same song for a feel-good moment.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Sure, everyone in the cast is hot, but the script is garbage. It sounded like it was written by a trashy version of Chat GPT.It's supposed to be funny, but it's pathetic how they are instantly super ugly and mean-spirited to each other when they have a miscommunication.It's SUPER predictable.Cliched end-of-movie singing, dancing scene.So much fighting.So many awkward moments.They say the movie is loosely based on Shakepeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"", but I think the Bard would be disgusted by the lack of intelligent language in the script. So many F-bombs. One similarity is that they get a wedding cake from a shop called ""Dogberry's"", which is the name of a character in the play.I cringed and rolled my eyes so many times.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
This movie is definitely not appropriate for kids. It portrays unhealthy relationships and extremely bad behavior.Kids will be completely bored because it's mostly adults talking to each other.Profanity and lots of F-bombs
A lesbian couple kisses and gets married
We see a topless woman
We see several shirtless men
A couple gropes each other inside their shorts.Two women wear bikini tops that barely cover anything.We see a ton of cleavage
A lot of sexual innuendo. We see an unmarried couple in the shower and bed together.We see two men smoke a joint.!"
"Anyone But You","ambusched94","31 December 2023",210,"A forgettable, expendable rom-com where all the somewhat funny, shock value scenes are exposed in the theatrical trailer and there is hardly any laugh-out-loud scenes in this film overall.While Glen Powell has the comedy chops and romantic charm for this film genre, to my astonishment it's the EXACT OPPOSITE for Sydney Sweeney. Her line delivery is dull and she has the same facial expressions, blank stare, dead eyes for most scenes in Anyone But You. You can tell she's acting as in she's not embodying the character in the story and she's simply reading the lines, not conveying any natural nuances in her character each time she does this. Sweeney's crying scene in the taxi felt unnaturally forced. I was surprised her acting was half-a**ed, whereas in the TV series Euphoria (2019-present) her acting feels natural. Or highly likely that she's a limited-range, one-note actress that can only do dark, coming-of-age drama genre and fails at rom-com. IMO, Powell and Sweeney had the most chemistry when their characters were arguing and hating each other. When they got all lovey dovey, the on-screen chemistry felt forced and it was lacking that romantic spark between their characters. I was not invested enough in their progressing relationship to care once they officially got together in the end.So one, I feel like Sweeney largely ruins the film with her bland acting and line delivery, and lack of emotiveness. A better choice for the lead actress in this film should've been a comedic actress or an actress who can deftly juggle comedic timing and dramatic, emotional scenes. If this film was made and released in the 2000s decade for example, Amanda Bynes would be a prime choice for the role of Bea. And two, the character development is lacking and backstory are just tacked-on but don't add any characterization substance. The screenplay pushes the two characters to meet instantaneously at the start of the film, so viewers don't get any individual scenes of each lead character beforehand leaving a lot of character backstory nonexistent. The screenplay gives a brief overlay of each of Ben's and Bea's backstory in a scene montage and it's the error of telling over showing, and it doesn't work, leaving a rushed characterization of both characters that cheapens the film.Supporting characters feel like caricatures and don't add anything to the story. No supporting character was memorable. Some corny dialogue and meta rom-com instances that seem shoehorned in. Also, I wish Darren Barnet (Paxton from the TV series Never Have I Ever (2020-2023)) had more scenes, dialogue and that he would've been the guy Bea ended up with if there was an unexpected surprise, twist ending, instead of the ""enemies to lovers"" and ""stuck together so they'll end up together"" overused romance tropes. But the screenplay is too safe and screenwriters would never be bold enough to rise up to a different, atypical ending like this.I did like that the majority of the film was set in Australia and a few of the songs used in the film's soundtrack.It's ironic that Dermot Mulroney and Rachel Griffiths are in this sucky rom-com when blasting back to the past to 1997, both Mulroney (as the leading man and love interest) and Griffiths (in a supporting role) starred in a first rate quality rom-com, My Best Friend's Wedding. This is why most of my fave rom-coms are from the '90s and the 2000s. When quality storytelling, chemistry, and character development reigned in comparison to this current rom-com garbage.Anyone But You is a derivative, formulaic rom-com that's ultimately unmemorable, vapid rom-com plot, and a waste of time. Just casually watch it once it comes out on streaming if you have nothing else to watch and don't care about draining 1 hour 43 minutes of your time."
"Anyone But You","dogonlion","10 February 2024",110,"Everything in this movie feels forced. The comedy is like ""please laugh, please laugh"". I guess that works on some. Nothing flows naturally. The way they love at first sight and all of the sudden start bickering is unrealistic. The bickering is annoying. Sydney Sweeney is a really good actress, I really liked her in The White Lotus, but she's hasn't been in a movie that uses her full potential yet. The movie is full of cliches. It even has the funny black friend with no love life. I'm really shocked by how much money this movie made. I guess as long as those kinds of movies make money they'll keep the same formula and keep factory produce them and soon will use artificial intelligence to write them."
"Anyone But You","miza004","22 December 2023",510,"This movie is exactly what I thought it would be so I can't complain too much.The two leads are both very attractive and have good chemistry, so that was entertaining to watch and nice on the eyes. It had some cute scenes. I gotta say the ensemble was pretty good if I laughed it was always because something one of them said. They were a bunch of goofy characters. I also enjoyed dermot mulroney's character when he was learning how to dive and the reoccurance of that at the end of the movie. It made me giggle.But I gotta say... the dialogue was very mediocre and at times just not good at all. It just lacked depth which again didn't expect it to have depth but still could have been better."

Overall, an incredibly formulaic Rom-Com that tries way too hard to capitalize on the popularity and looks of Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney, but fails hard as it is so predictable and barely funny.Bad Direction (The whole movie just feels like the studio shelled out something to tick boxes rather than make a well thought-out comedy (this included plot concepts, wardrobing, and jokes) because that's what they think the audience 'wants' as they try too hard to be 'modern,' meaning the director couldn't make any creative decisions; the direction on both a macro and microscale feels very formulaic to other Rom-Coms; the direction of actors is very bad as he does not establish any chemistry for the cast as all the performances feel mundane and toneless; the storytelling is a formulaic and predictable Rom-Com), Bad Acting (Bad to Pretty Bad from Sydney Sweeney (The overall performance feels mundane and toneless and she fails to establish any chemistry with Glen Powell, but she does have some moments where she does a decent to pretty good job), Decent to Pretty Good from Glen Powell (The only positive performance in the movie as he holds his own and leads the movie well as a Rom-Com lead (it's just the material is so bad he can only do so much)), Decent from Alexandra Shipp (Actually holds her own well and shows some a little range (which is a lot given this movie)), Bad from GaTa (Cannot match the levels of any of the other actors and feels very toneless with little effort), Pretty Bad from Hadley Robinson (Just doesn't offer anything), Decent from Michelle Hurd (Shows some experience and decent timing), Decent from Dermot Mulroney (Has some charisma and timing), Decent from Charlee Fraser (The most surprising performance of the movie as she holds her own fairly well and establishes some charm and chemistry with Glen Powell), Very Bad from the rest of the cast (Just a lot of toneless and stereotypical Rom-Com performances; there is no chemistry in the entire cast)), Very Bad Story (The concept is a modern retelling of Shakespeare's 'Much Ado About Nothing,' but it does not do anything to be unique as it just follows the cookie cutter Rom-Com plot (mixed with forced modern references); the story construction is incredibly formulaic as each scene is incredibly predictable on what is going to happen and where it is going to go; because the movie is so predictable, there is a flow because it just follows this boilerplate to a tea; the character writing is terrible as all the characters as so shallow and stereotypical to Rom-Coms (and things are brought up for characters that never get addressed or add more depth to the characters)), Very Bad Screenplay (The dialogue is atrocious and very predictable (the movie forces in so many modern references that it just feels like they are pandering to the youth rather than writing realistic dialogue); the joke hit rate is probably 1 out of every 5 jokes (and some of the jokes are just so stupid that its cringe at how they even made this movie); the symbolism is incredibly overt (with the quotes from the source material and the messages of the story being overlaid onto the screen); the foreshadowing is incredibly overt that it makes the movie incredibly predictable), Decent Score; Decent Soundtrack (Did enjoy the songs they chose), Pretty Good Cinematography (Very polished as you could tell the studio put in a lot of money to make this movie), Pretty Bad Sound (Some of the sound effects are just off from what happened), Decent Editing (The actual edit was very polished and felt like it had a big budget; the cut for the movie just feels weird as it is obvious where they did reshoots and what was originally shot), Good Costumes (They made a very conscious decision with what each character was wearing to get people to watch this movie (and I respect that)), Plot Structure followed the source material's and Rom-Com template to a tee (which made the movie incredibly formulaic and predictable), Pacing was decent (as it kept the Rom-Com pace), Climax was so forced and incredibly formulaic (which made me cringe very hard when watching this movie), Tone was very similar to other Rom-Coms (especially from the early 2010s), It was so obvious where there were reshoots for this movie as some of the scenes were so bad and some were more tolerable."
"Anyone But You","masonsaul","30 December 2023",710,"Anyone But You is an enjoyably cynical rom com that still has plenty of heartfelt romance at its centre. Just getting one of these theatrically released currently is kind of a miracle and it plays squarely to the genre's strengths. All its beats are predictable in the best way.Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell are on their way to becoming genuine movie stars and this film only further solidifies that. The constant barbs they send each other's way for the majority of the film are really funny and the chemistry they're constantly trying to deny has a real spark to it.This isn't Will Gluck's first rom com and that's apparent in the good ways. The broad physical comedy is balanced nicely by the snappy wit interspersed throughout and it's surprisingly epic (a lot more helicopter stuff than expected). A good soundtrack always helps with this genre and the one here nails it."
"Anyone But You","Remmuchan","27 December 2023",310,"I cannot for the life of me understand how this ended up being a movie shown in theaters.

It was the biggest waste of my time ever.I cannot tell you how many times I cringed watching this and how many times I wanted it to just end. The acting was AWFUL, especially from the lead actress who tried so hard to act seductive but it just came off as terrible. Everything about this movie made no sense. The plot line was awful. It felt like watching a really cheesy Netflix rom-com but a hundred times worse. The shocking nude scenes just added to its awfulness.I can't get over how bad this is and I really think they just wanted to make something to tick all the boxes of what a rom-com is except it did not tick any of those boxes at all.

"Anyone But You","MichaelByTheSea","26 December 2023",910,"This was like an R rated raunchy Hallmark movie where people actually have sex. I can do without the miscommunication trope that drove apart a couple that seemed to be connecting, but I enjoyed the banter and really enjoyed the stars.""Serious"" critics typically don't appreciate the rom-com genre and judge them harshly. I went with my adult children and we all loved the movie. My kids make fun of my love for Hallmark movies, but even they liked this one. We laughed out loud repeatedly and walked out smiling. I love that feeling.Sure, the script is flawed, the plot's ridiculous, and some of the dialogue is a bit off, but Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney light up the screen with their amazing chemistry. They're extraordinary specimens and look like they spend 6 hours a day in the gym, but I also like them as actors. Glen Powell was really good in another enjoyable modern rom-com with Zoey Deutch called ""Set It Up"" and he's fearless here, especially with the over the top body humor.Sydney Sweeney is certainly voluptuous, and gorgeous to look at, but she's also established herself as a great actress in more critic friendly shows like ""Euphoria"" and ""White Lotus"". Edgy and dark is fine, and it certainly gets taken more seriously by the critics, but I prefer getting lost in an escapist rom-com that doesn't involve terrible people doing terrible things.I want more of this."

"Anyone But You","NatKaminska","28 December 2023",110,"I need to warn those of you who want to spend your money on this thing: don't do it, not worth it. I watched the movie and it was horrible. It tried to be a charming '90s and '2000s rom-com, yet it failed in every department except with the male lead. Glen Powell is the only good thing about this movie.'Anyone but you' is full of cliches and while you can do cliches in a good way, and make genuine, great gem of a specific genre, this is not the case here. The movie is boring, shallow, cringe comedy with typical cringe, over-the-top, not-funny jokes, maybe 1 joke lands in the entire movie, that's how bad it is. The supposedly 'hilarious' nude scene on the cliff, especially the part when Powell is bending over, completely naked, holding his balls in his hands, is the next level of cringe, nothing funny, nothing charming, just cringe, awkward, awful. It's also full of heavy, not subtle, and obvious cultural references as if the writers just wrote down popular internet memes. Man, these writers really don't have any respect for the viewers. I basically wanted to walk out of this movie after the first 15 minutes.The romance part is badly done as well. The chemistry is average at best, just like a normal chemistry between two beautiful people - they are easy on the eyes oh right, like most people in this industry, but nothing more. They are not Mulder and Scully or Hanks and Ryan. Another problem with the main couple is that only Powell is to some degree likable, even tho the script doesn't make his character particularly likable, Powell's natural charisma and charm do the trick. With Sweeney that doesn't exist, she is utterly unlikeable as Bea, and this flaw kills the romance and fun completely. Despite what was said about this duo during the last summer and what some of their blind stans and the media still say now, they don't fit together as a rom-com couple at all!The screenplay itself doesn't help the actors achieve any chemistry, as the entire story is incredibly predictable, and thus boring, with awful dialogues and wooden acting most of the time.Nothing really happens in this movie! Any romantic comedy has to have some stakes in the relationship, some solid drama, and funny, unexpected twists and turns that make sense at least in the fictional universe. In this movie, the conflict that starts Ben and Bea's feud doesn't even make sense! Literally, one minute of simple explanation would clear the air between them, as they are visibly attracted to each other, from the first moment they meet. So the whole basis of this film, that they hate each other, doesn't make sense. We needed some stronger reason for the hate here.Yes, I'm aware that this movie is based on Shakespeare's play 'Much Ado About Nothing', and that one point of that play is that a great fuss/drama between the protagonists started from something insignificant ('nothing'), but every artist, and not only an artist but average person, knows that film is a completely different medium than a theater play, and what worked in a play about romance, written in Shakespeare's times, doesn't work as well in a modern, romantic comedy film. This movie isn't written intelligently enough to make it work either. Again, for the plot to be compelling in this film, we needed a stronger reason for hatred between the main characters, and the development of the characters, and we got neither of those things. Throughout the film, the characters are basic sketches, and we don't know much about them till the end.Then, during the next two, remaining acts of the movie, also nothing really happens. They decide to fake that they are together out of the blue, and their reasons for it are also simply not good enough for the audience to care about the characters and the story. Throughout the entire film, we don't see at all that Ben genuinely desires his ex, and Bea's parents don't have enough of the presence, are completely flat, insignificant characters for the audience to believe or care that she needs to lie to them, which were the two main reasons for the masquerade. Therefore, another giant flaw of the script: the motivations of the main characters that are supposed to push the plot forward are insufficient to be credible and interesting to the audience.In general, the problem is that nothing is fleshed out in 'Anyone but You' - not the main storyline, not the two main leads, not the background characters, drama, or comedy.The 'meta' lines in the script, the kinda 'wink- wink we know it's typical rom-com trope' also don't work because for this to work, the entire script would have to be much more intelligent and satirical, and it isn't smart or a satire at all! It just tried to cheat the audience by doing this, or the writers gave themselves an easy excuse for the rest of their bad writing, and again - it doesn't work. Nothing works in this movie.Yet another big problem: Sydney doesn't have a talent for comedy, sorry. Her delivery is very bland and too stiff, her character is flat, like cut out of a cardboard figure. I just don't understand how someone like her could get the role specifically in romantic comedy if she doesn't fit this role at all. Weren't there some other, better, and actually comedy-talented, cute actresses available during the casting process? Or was it just an easy money grab because it is Sydney Sweeney from 'Euphoria'?Glen is the only one who can be genuinely hilarious and gives his all, and that is not a surprise for anyone who follows his career. Glen already showed his comedy talent in Scream Queens but also proved it as Hangman in Top Gun. He is a very funny guy in real life too, as you can see in his interviews, so it's obvious comedy is natural for him. That's why he absolutely is in his element in this movie, and he 'feels it' but the problem is no one of the rest of the cast is, including Sydney. And Glen alone is still not good enough to save this movie.When you have such a difference in comedic chops between two leads in a romantic comedy that is a giant problem. I don't know if you noticed, but the hilarious thing is, you can already see in the trailers, that Sydney is not good at all in this movie. I remember that I commented her delivery is terrible the minute I watched the trailer!After I watched this movie, I definitely think Glen is much better in romantic comedies when paired with Zoey Deutch. Glen has a way better, more organic, and natural chemistry with Zoey than with Sydney, maybe because Zoey has a comedy talent just like Glen. I saw on Glen's IMDB that he is going to star in another comedy with Zoey, hopefully, better written than this one, so I will wait for it.To sum up, 'Anyone but You' is not worth one second of your time, your money, or any buzz, just wait for the the movie to appear on the streaming platforms. It doesn't have the great main couple, it doesn't have good background characters, it doesn't have the charm, wit, and natural flow that romantic comedies of the '90s or early '2000 had, like She's All That, Love Actually, Holiday, 10 Things I Hate About You, or How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.It simply doesn't have good or even decent writing! And I'm not the enemy of romantic comedies, I'm a woman and aspiring filmmaker, I love great romantic comedies just like any other great movie, of any other genre. But this movie is so bad, that I genuinely felt ashamed while watching it - I felt ashamed for the filmmakers who made this, especially the writers. Don't bother!"

It turns out that his friend is marrying her sister. The two enemies have to attend a destination wedding in Australia.Sweeney and Powell are trying all kind of broad physical humor. They are both gorgeous and both have good charisma. Neither are outright comedians and that is important. They are mildly funny but are rarely the funniest part. The first big laugh is the WTF old guy while the two bicker. The butt grabbing scene kinda works, but the leads may be overshadowed by a koala. This duo tries very hard.

God knows why he can barely swim but he can teach diving.The female lead, I take no pleasure in saying this, tends to speak at the other actors instead of to them.I get that the writers were trying to go for a Shakespeare type of thing, like Much Ado About Nothing, but the movie simply wasn't comedic enough to have unconvincing character choices. You can get away with a lot of goofy stuff in a slapstick comedy. But this had mostly drama. So the characters need to make sense.I am sorry. I really wanted to like this.There were hints of genius. There was some good physical comedy and a few touchimg moments. But the cringe worthy flaws buried them."
"Anyone But You","gerrgrady-86307","27 December 2023",210,"My husband and I chose this movie as a Saturday treat. We left around the halfway mark because I kept hoping that it would improve - a waste of time & our weekly movie budget. The actors were given dialog that was juvenile and scene set-ups that were embarrassing. Lots of gratitious nudity and shots of partial nudity. Anyone interested in seeing this movie should just watch the trailer - it gives viewers a good picture of what they'll see at the theater so they don't waste their time sitting through a really bad movie. It was great seeing Bryan Brown but I wish he had chosen a better vehicle in which to appear than this dreck. I had greater expections for Glen Powell, but then maybe this is the level of his actual talent. Sad."
"Anyone But You","DeanAmythe","4 January 2024",410,"Never been into romcoms all that much (I watch movies alone all day as a true cinglephile), though I acknowledge their importance in filling the void for comfort watches: predictable, feel-good, and just the right amount of schmaltz - perfect for a night out (or in). Their template structure isn't so much a concern rather than an obstacle to overcome, which can be achieved with a fun gimmick of some sort, or, simply, by hitting the comedic marks. If this genre wants to see its resurgence these points are vital, and last year's NO HARD FEELINGS was eager to prove that, a return to form yet still raunchy and imbued with a surprising air of maturity - and even when the jokes didn't land, there was still enjoyment to be found in the excellent(ly cast) leads. ANYONE BUT YOU is as back-to-basics as it could get and appears to be, to a certain extent, aware of that, though here the drive to still be its own thing is completely absent. What immediately stands out is the central 'do-they, don't-they', which pretty much feeds directly into the classic plot structure and is barely taken advantage of. When it is being used for comedic purposes, it easily produces the highlights of the film, like the view/spider scene. Most of this, though, is by-the-numbers and safe, lacking any edge or remarkable features aside from the leads' sex appeal (on that front, the quality of the casting is equal to NO HARD FEELINGS). Speaking of them, Powell is as fun as expected - he would most likely be a solid movie star if the current Hollywood system allowed for those - but Sweeney? No clue what she's doing with those line reads, constantly sounding like a bad impression of an American high school girl with a ready disinterest in everything. Not that she has that much to work with anyway, as the script suffers from eye-rollers of jokes, that first half especially bursting with ""did I just say that out loud?"" humor. My sold out screening was awfully silent through most of this, though maybe they were just there for the aforementioned hotties. Just so you know: you don't get a (proper) view of Sweeney's melons, but you do get to see a squeezed Australian glans. 4/10."

I could feel my brain cells dying as I watched this absolute mess of a rom-com.Sydney Sweeney was horrible and has all but ruined her career. She could not make any part of her character believable. Very hard to watch.I'm embarrassed for Brian brown for having anything to do with this movie. He couldn't save this film from disaster.The script jumped all over the place and was so completely unrealistic... not once did the film make me believe any part of it could happen.The film relies on poor humour, And, what they don't show you in the commercials is that it's full of far-left LGBTQ propaganda.I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy."
"Anyone But You","ethanbresnett","6 January 2024",710,"Anyone But You caught me a little bit by surprise I must say. Perhaps that's because my expectations were quite low, but they really needn't have been as this film is a really solid romcom.Primarily this comes from Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney. A romcom lives and dies by its romantic leads, and they are both great in this, nailing the weird and evolving chemistry between their two characters. They are each decently well written, feeling believable and engaging.On top of this, there is a fairly forgettable but perfectly pleasant assortment of supporting characters who add some extra levels of humour to the piece.Speaking of humour, it is a bit hit and miss in this film. There aren't many big laughs, but it is amusing and does have a light and goofy tone throughout that is befitting of any romcom.Now, this film doesn't really reinvent the wheel in any way. It has all the same story beats as most romcoms and doesn't take too many risks. Therefore the plot is fairly mediocre and (as with practically all romcoms) is far too predictable. This never really gets in the way of the fun though, but the inevitable ending does make it feel a teensy bit too long.Overall though I think this is a really solid film. It has a good tone, a couple of engaging leads, and will give you a few laughs too."
"Anyone But You","tm-sheehan","5 January 2024",610,"My Review. Anyone But You
My Rating. 6:10Very very loosely based on Shakespeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"" with even a few quotations in the background and title cards this pleasant enough rom com reminds me of a line from a 16 th Century play The Merchant of Venice by same William Shakespeare, ""All that glisters is not gold"".Which of course translates in today's language ""All that glitters is not gold "".Anyone But You has a pleasant cast set in and around Sydney which is fun to spot locations like the QVB building, and our beautiful harbour vistas and pristine beaches.I was reminded of a far superior Classic romantic comedy ""My Best Friend's Wedding "" 1997 when I saw the actor playing the brides father Dermot Mulroney who achieved great success playing a similar lead 26 years ago to Glen Powell who plays Ben the romantic lead man in this movie.I enjoyed both the young leads Sydney Sweeney who plays Bea and Glen Powell who play the star crossed lovers .The differences and similarities for me in great romance comedies with weddings like My Best Friends Wedding and more recently Crazy Rich Asians is obvious they all look fabulous with surroundings that celebrate the affluence of wealthy privileged people .Where they differ from each other is in the quality of the script writing in this case by Ilana Wolpert and Will Gluck.Light comedy can be clever if it's not pretentious why try and improve on Shakespeare? It's an impossible task.Anyone But You is entertaining but parts of it I found really irritating and contrived.Adding a same sex wedding was a nice modern touch but it's the most heterosexual same sex wedding I've ever seen not one Gay in this village except Claudia and Halle the betrothed couple.The most irritating characters for me were the parents of the brides played by Dermot Mulroney, Rachel Griffiths, Bryan Brown and Michelle Hurd they all seemed to be trying to hard .I can't be to critical of this light comedy that probably appeals to a younger audience demographic than myself .I hope it succeeds overseas as we need to export more home grown cinema product from Australia but we can't just rely on great scenery and cute animal platitudes like winking koalas ."
"Anyone But You","psxexperten","9 February 2024",110,"Horrible, don't waste your time
Weak story, unnecessarily extensive vulgar language, and excessive nudity humiliates the actors. Embarrassing movie that degrades men and women and shows no imagination. It is very sad to believe that this movie appeals to people. Downright stupid with no redeeming qualities.I had respect for some of these actors before I watched this movie. All I can say is that perhaps they will do anything for money. I cannot see any other reason to have participated in this film and I am scared for any teenagers or young adults that are entertained by showing off your body and acting like adolescent fools."
"Anyone But You","movieman6-413-929510","5 January 2024",510,"Anyone But You is a new romantic comedy directed, written and produced in part by Will Gluck, director of Easy A and Friends with Benefits.Bea (Sydney Sweeney) and Ben (Glen Powell) haven't seen each other since a first date. When they are both invited to the same wedding, the two meet again.They learn that people are trying to hook them up so they don't cause further problems during the wedding. This is why they pretend, to get rid of the fuss.Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell have good chemistry together in the film and both know how to play well and playfully with and against each other. Despite their chemistry, the overall film is unfortunately more on the standard side of a romantic comedy. This gives the film game its well-known and predictable sides. Other moments come across as a bit too forced. For co-writer Ilana Wolpert, this is only her first written film story.Another downside of the film is the amount of extra characters. Many of these extras bring their own kind of comedy, but otherwise have little real use in the film. With a few fewer of these extras, the film could have been better focused, with a shorter running time."

"Anyone But You","alyetc","28 December 2023",510,"We've seen a million movies set at weddings before - where even the couple getting married gets invested in the main couples status. So I knew a lot of the tropes would be the same, but it was the same but a bit worse. The main couple story I actually really liked, I thought they were hilarious and cute and beat out other movies with the same storyline. It was everything else that fell short. The background characters felt cheesy and fake. All surface level gags or you didn't really get to know them, nothing felt genuine - case in point Bea's parents were incredibly unrealistic, no ones that out of touch. Even Bea's background felt half-done, never explaining why she didn't want law school."

Its repetitive and cliché romantic comedy storyline lacked originality, leaving the audience unengaged. The attempts at humor fell flat, resulting in a tedious and cringe-worthy viewing experience. To add to the disappointment, the lead actress's annoying voice only added to the overall lackluster quality of the film, making it a forgettable and uninspiring cinematic endeavor. Terrible acting and story. I don't understand the high rating of this movie, or the hype. Save your time and skip this one. The movie is downright horrible, with uncomfortable scenes that make you question their choices. Shame on them for delivering such a poorly written script, leading to an overall disappointing and regrettable cinematic experience."
"Anyone But You","barbett-1","1 January 2024",510,"Neither brilliant nor dreadful, ""Anyone But You"" features a cast of characters that are unbelievably attractive and, apparently, insanely wealthy. It stars Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeny's breasts in the formulatic equivalent of a Hallmark Movie knock-off. You know the drill - two perfect young people meet, are instantly attracted to each other, are separated by a misunderstanding with hilarious hijinks ensuing. The misunderstanding is eventually resolved, love blooms once more, and all ends well.What sets this film apart is excellent cinematography with lovely wide-angle views of the Australian countryside. The supporting cast is very capable although the Australian men are played as oafish stereotypes. Glen Powell plays his part well, but Sydney Sweeny appears to be reading her lines from a teleprompter offscreen. Not the worst movie out this holiday season and enjoyable as long as you refrain from high expectations."
"Anyone But You","pkertes-59666","5 January 2024",410,"I went to see this movie because I am a sucker for a romantic comedy, even the average ones (and let's face it, most of them are). Having seen the trailer, I had low expectations, yet this film still managed to come it at an even lower level.Boy meets girl, they hit it off briefly, there is a misunderstanding and when they reconnect through a friend/family wedding, they hate each other. Except as anyone could predict, ultimately they don't really, but it takes an eternity of inauthentic, puerile dross to get there. No tissues needed here.The acting is generally average to poor, and local actors like Rachel Griffiths and Bryan Brown (much of it filmed in Australia) do the minimum required, and are completely wasted here. The script is juvenile, facile and has little in common with reality. The direction is pedestrian and much of the movie is a travel ad for Sydney. Throw in plastic, unlikeable characters and a healthy dose of gratuitous nudity. The attempts at comedy are almost laughable as that, and what little romance eventuates at the end fails to convince after nearly two hours of tripe beforehand.Not recommended, even if you are a fan of the genre."
"Anyone But You","trinaboice","8 January 2024",410,"IN A NUTSHELL:
After an amazing first date, Bea and Ben's fiery attraction turns ice-cold until they find themselves unexpectedly reunited at a destination wedding in Australia that their exes also attend. So, they do what any two mature adults would do: pretend to be a couple amidst the fighting.The film was directed by Will Gluck, who also wrote it with Ilana Wolpert.Ultimately, this is like a rated R Hallmark movie with lots of raunch.THINGS I LIKED:
There is plenty of eye candy here for everyone. The cast is filled with good-looking people and includes Sydney Sweeney, Glen Powell, Alexandra Shipp, Hadley Robinson, GaTa, Michelle Hurd, Dermot Mulroney, Rachel Griffiths, Bryan Brown, and more.Sydney Sweeney was bit by a spider in the movie while filming. That famous clip was posted online and got a lot of stir.We get to visit Australia during the film.The cast is diverse, offering a variety of stories about romance and love.The last scene takes clips from the whole movie and has all of the actors sing the same song for a feel-good moment.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Sure, everyone in the cast is hot, but the script is garbage. It sounded like it was written by a trashy version of Chat GPT.It's supposed to be funny, but it's pathetic how they are instantly super ugly and mean-spirited to each other when they have a miscommunication.It's SUPER predictable.Cliched end-of-movie singing, dancing scene.So much fighting.So many awkward moments.They say the movie is loosely based on Shakepeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"", but I think the Bard would be disgusted by the lack of intelligent language in the script. So many F-bombs. One similarity is that they get a wedding cake from a shop called ""Dogberry's"", which is the name of a character in the play.I cringed and rolled my eyes so many times.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
This movie is definitely not appropriate for kids. It portrays unhealthy relationships and extremely bad behavior.Kids will be completely bored because it's mostly adults talking to each other.Profanity and lots of F-bombs
A lesbian couple kisses and gets married
We see a topless woman
We see several shirtless men
A couple gropes each other inside their shorts.Two women wear bikini tops that barely cover anything.We see a ton of cleavage
A lot of sexual innuendo. We see an unmarried couple in the shower and bed together.We see two men smoke a joint.!"
"Anyone But You","ambusched94","31 December 2023",210,"A forgettable, expendable rom-com where all the somewhat funny, shock value scenes are exposed in the theatrical trailer and there is hardly any laugh-out-loud scenes in this film overall.While Glen Powell has the comedy chops and romantic charm for this film genre, to my astonishment it's the EXACT OPPOSITE for Sydney Sweeney. Her line delivery is dull and she has the same facial expressions, blank stare, dead eyes for most scenes in Anyone But You. You can tell she's acting as in she's not embodying the character in the story and she's simply reading the lines, not conveying any natural nuances in her character each time she does this. Sweeney's crying scene in the taxi felt unnaturally forced. I was surprised her acting was half-a**ed, whereas in the TV series Euphoria (2019-present) her acting feels natural. Or highly likely that she's a limited-range, one-note actress that can only do dark, coming-of-age drama genre and fails at rom-com. IMO, Powell and Sweeney had the most chemistry when their characters were arguing and hating each other. When they got all lovey dovey, the on-screen chemistry felt forced and it was lacking that romantic spark between their characters. I was not invested enough in their progressing relationship to care once they officially got together in the end.So one, I feel like Sweeney largely ruins the film with her bland acting and line delivery, and lack of emotiveness. A better choice for the lead actress in this film should've been a comedic actress or an actress who can deftly juggle comedic timing and dramatic, emotional scenes. If this film was made and released in the 2000s decade for example, Amanda Bynes would be a prime choice for the role of Bea. And two, the character development is lacking and backstory are just tacked-on but don't add any characterization substance. The screenplay pushes the two characters to meet instantaneously at the start of the film, so viewers don't get any individual scenes of each lead character beforehand leaving a lot of character backstory nonexistent. The screenplay gives a brief overlay of each of Ben's and Bea's backstory in a scene montage and it's the error of telling over showing, and it doesn't work, leaving a rushed characterization of both characters that cheapens the film.Supporting characters feel like caricatures and don't add anything to the story. No supporting character was memorable. Some corny dialogue and meta rom-com instances that seem shoehorned in. Also, I wish Darren Barnet (Paxton from the TV series Never Have I Ever (2020-2023)) had more scenes, dialogue and that he would've been the guy Bea ended up with if there was an unexpected surprise, twist ending, instead of the ""enemies to lovers"" and ""stuck together so they'll end up together"" overused romance tropes. But the screenplay is too safe and screenwriters would never be bold enough to rise up to a different, atypical ending like this.I did like that the majority of the film was set in Australia and a few of the songs used in the film's soundtrack.It's ironic that Dermot Mulroney and Rachel Griffiths are in this sucky rom-com when blasting back to the past to 1997, both Mulroney (as the leading man and love interest) and Griffiths (in a supporting role) starred in a first rate quality rom-com, My Best Friend's Wedding. This is why most of my fave rom-coms are from the '90s and the 2000s. When quality storytelling, chemistry, and character development reigned in comparison to this current rom-com garbage.Anyone But You is a derivative, formulaic rom-com that's ultimately unmemorable, vapid rom-com plot, and a waste of time. Just casually watch it once it comes out on streaming if you have nothing else to watch and don't care about draining 1 hour 43 minutes of your time."
"Anyone But You","dogonlion","10 February 2024",110,"Everything in this movie feels forced. The comedy is like ""please laugh, please laugh"". I guess that works on some. Nothing flows naturally. The way they love at first sight and all of the sudden start bickering is unrealistic. The bickering is annoying. Sydney Sweeney is a really good actress, I really liked her in The White Lotus, but she's hasn't been in a movie that uses her full potential yet. The movie is full of cliches. It even has the funny black friend with no love life. I'm really shocked by how much money this movie made.

I also enjoyed dermot mulroney's character when he was learning how to dive and the reoccurance of that at the end of the movie.

Just getting one of these theatrically released currently is kind of a miracle and it plays squarely to the genre's strengths. All its beats are predictable in the best way.Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell are on their way to becoming genuine movie stars and this film only further solidifies that. The constant barbs they send each other's way for the majority of the film are really funny and the chemistry they're constantly trying to deny has a real spark to it.This isn't Will Gluck's first rom com and that's apparent in the good ways. The broad physical comedy is balanced nicely by the snappy wit interspersed throughout and it's surprisingly epic (a lot more helicopter stuff than expected).

I went with my adult children and we all loved the movie. My kids make fun of my love for Hallmark movies, but even they liked this one. We laughed out loud repeatedly and walked out smiling. I love that feeling.Sure, the script is flawed, the plot's ridiculous, and some of the dialogue is a bit off, but Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney light up the screen with their amazing chemistry. They're extraordinary specimens and look like they spend 6 hours a day in the gym, but I also like them as actors. Glen Powell was really good in another enjoyable modern rom-com with Zoey Deutch called ""Set It Up"" and he's fearless here, especially with the over the top body humor.Sydney Sweeney is certainly voluptuous, and gorgeous to look at, but she's also established herself as a great actress in more critic friendly shows like ""Euphoria"" and ""White Lotus"". Edgy and dark is fine, and it certainly gets taken more seriously by the critics, but I prefer getting lost in an escapist rom-com that doesn't involve terrible people doing terrible things.I want more of this."

"Anyone But You","NatKaminska","28 December 2023",110,"I need to warn those of you who want to spend your money on this thing: don't do it, not worth it. I watched the movie and it was horrible. It tried to be a charming '90s and '2000s rom-com, yet it failed in every department except with the male lead. Glen Powell is the only good thing about this movie.'Anyone but you' is full of cliches and while you can do cliches in a good way, and make genuine, great gem of a specific genre, this is not the case here. The movie is boring, shallow, cringe comedy with typical cringe, over-the-top, not-funny jokes, maybe 1 joke lands in the entire movie, that's how bad it is. The supposedly 'hilarious' nude scene on the cliff, especially the part when Powell is bending over, completely naked, holding his balls in his hands, is the next level of cringe, nothing funny, nothing charming, just cringe, awkward, awful. It's also full of heavy, not subtle, and obvious cultural references as if the writers just wrote down popular internet memes. Man, these writers really don't have any respect for the viewers. I basically wanted to walk out of this movie after the first 15 minutes.The romance part is badly done as well. The chemistry is average at best, just like a normal chemistry between two beautiful people - they are easy on the eyes oh right, like most people in this industry, but nothing more. They are not Mulder and Scully or Hanks and Ryan. Another problem with the main couple is that only Powell is to some degree likable, even tho the script doesn't make his character particularly likable, Powell's natural charisma and charm do the trick. With Sweeney that doesn't exist, she is utterly unlikeable as Bea, and this flaw kills the romance and fun completely. Despite what was said about this duo during the last summer and what some of their blind stans and the media still say now, they don't fit together as a rom-com couple at all!The screenplay itself doesn't help the actors achieve any chemistry, as the entire story is incredibly predictable, and thus boring, with awful dialogues and wooden acting most of the time.Nothing really happens in this movie! Any romantic comedy has to have some stakes in the relationship, some solid drama, and funny, unexpected twists and turns that make sense at least in the fictional universe. In this movie, the conflict that starts Ben and Bea's feud doesn't even make sense! Literally, one minute of simple explanation would clear the air between them, as they are visibly attracted to each other, from the first moment they meet. So the whole basis of this film, that they hate each other, doesn't make sense. We needed some stronger reason for the hate here.Yes, I'm aware that this movie is based on Shakespeare's play 'Much Ado About Nothing', and that one point of that play is that a great fuss/drama between the protagonists started from something insignificant ('nothing'), but every artist, and not only an artist but average person, knows that film is a completely different medium than a theater play, and what worked in a play about romance, written in Shakespeare's times, doesn't work as well in a modern, romantic comedy film. This movie isn't written intelligently enough to make it work either. Again, for the plot to be compelling in this film, we needed a stronger reason for hatred between the main characters, and the development of the characters, and we got neither of those things. Throughout the film, the characters are basic sketches, and we don't know much about them till the end.Then, during the next two, remaining acts of the movie, also nothing really happens. They decide to fake that they are together out of the blue, and their reasons for it are also simply not good enough for the audience to care about the characters and the story. Throughout the entire film, we don't see at all that Ben genuinely desires his ex, and Bea's parents don't have enough of the presence, are completely flat, insignificant characters for the audience to believe or care that she needs to lie to them, which were the two main reasons for the masquerade. Therefore, another giant flaw of the script: the motivations of the main characters that are supposed to push the plot forward are insufficient to be credible and interesting to the audience.In general, the problem is that nothing is fleshed out in 'Anyone but You' - not the main storyline, not the two main leads, not the background characters, drama, or comedy.The 'meta' lines in the script, the kinda 'wink- wink we know it's typical rom-com trope' also don't work because for this to work, the entire script would have to be much more intelligent and satirical, and it isn't smart or a satire at all! It just tried to cheat the audience by doing this, or the writers gave themselves an easy excuse for the rest of their bad writing, and again - it doesn't work. Nothing works in this movie.Yet another big problem: Sydney doesn't have a talent for comedy, sorry. Her delivery is very bland and too stiff, her character is flat, like cut out of a cardboard figure. I just don't understand how someone like her could get the role specifically in romantic comedy if she doesn't fit this role at all. Weren't there some other, better, and actually comedy-talented, cute actresses available during the casting process? Or was it just an easy money grab because it is Sydney Sweeney from 'Euphoria'?Glen is the only one who can be genuinely hilarious and gives his all, and that is not a surprise for anyone who follows his career. Glen already showed his comedy talent in Scream Queens but also proved it as Hangman in Top Gun. He is a very funny guy in real life too, as you can see in his interviews, so it's obvious comedy is natural for him. That's why he absolutely is in his element in this movie, and he 'feels it' but the problem is no one of the rest of the cast is, including Sydney. And Glen alone is still not good enough to save this movie.When you have such a difference in comedic chops between two leads in a romantic comedy that is a giant problem. I don't know if you noticed, but the hilarious thing is, you can already see in the trailers, that Sydney is not good at all in this movie. I remember that I commented her delivery is terrible the minute I watched the trailer!After I watched this movie, I definitely think Glen is much better in romantic comedies when paired with Zoey Deutch. Glen has a way better, more organic, and natural chemistry with Zoey than with Sydney, maybe because Zoey has a comedy talent just like Glen. I saw on Glen's IMDB that he is going to star in another comedy with Zoey, hopefully, better written than this one, so I will wait for it.To sum up, 'Anyone but You' is not worth one second of your time, your money, or any buzz, just wait for the the movie to appear on the streaming platforms. It doesn't have the great main couple, it doesn't have good background characters, it doesn't have the charm, wit, and natural flow that romantic comedies of the '90s or early '2000 had, like She's All That, Love Actually, Holiday, 10 Things I Hate About You, or How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.It simply doesn't have good or even decent writing! And I'm not the enemy of romantic comedies, I'm a woman and aspiring filmmaker, I love great romantic comedies just like any other great movie, of any other genre. But this movie is so bad, that I genuinely felt ashamed while watching it - I felt ashamed for the filmmakers who made this, especially the writers. Don't bother!"
"Anyone But You","SnoopyStyle","24 February 2024",610,"Bea (Sydney Sweeney) meets Ben (Glen Powell) in a coffee shop and they hook up. There are misunderstandings next morning and they leave angry. It turns out that his friend is marrying her sister. The two enemies have to attend a destination wedding in Australia.Sweeney and Powell are trying all kind of broad physical humor. They are both gorgeous and both have good charisma. Neither are outright comedians and that is important. They are mildly funny but are rarely the funniest part. The first big laugh is the WTF old guy while the two bicker. The butt grabbing scene kinda works, but the leads may be overshadowed by a koala. This duo tries very hard. It's so ridiculous that it's mildly funny."
"Anyone But You","johnnymonsarrat","3 February 2024",410,"Hello again, fellow film travelers.I have to wonder what happened to the writing of this movie. There are some interesting and touching twists to the plot. But mainly it seems plot driven, not character driven. Characters don't make consistent choices with their personality or logic, for example what happens with the parents at the end.The male lead has an acting style that's full of confidence, but he's supposed to be a comic figure that has disabling phobias. God knows why he can barely swim but he can teach diving.The female lead, I take no pleasure in saying this, tends to speak at the other actors instead of to them.I get that the writers were trying to go for a Shakespeare type of thing, like Much Ado About Nothing, but the movie simply wasn't comedic enough to have unconvincing character choices. You can get away with a lot of goofy stuff in a slapstick comedy. But this had mostly drama. So the characters need to make sense.I am sorry. I really wanted to like this.There were hints of genius. There was some good physical comedy and a few touchimg moments. But the cringe worthy flaws buried them."
"Anyone But You","gerrgrady-86307","27 December 2023",210,"My husband and I chose this movie as a Saturday treat. We left around the halfway mark because I kept hoping that it would improve - a waste of time & our weekly movie budget. The actors were given dialog that was juvenile and scene set-ups that were embarrassing. Lots of gratitious nudity and shots of partial nudity. Anyone interested in seeing this movie should just watch the trailer - it gives viewers a good picture of what they'll see at the theater so they don't waste their time sitting through a really bad movie. It was great seeing Bryan Brown but I wish he had chosen a better vehicle in which to appear than this dreck. I had greater expections for Glen Powell, but then maybe this is the level of his actual talent. Sad."
"Anyone But You","DeanAmythe","4 January 2024",410,"Never been into romcoms all that much (I watch movies alone all day as a true cinglephile), though I acknowledge their importance in filling the void for comfort watches: predictable, feel-good, and just the right amount of schmaltz - perfect for a night out (or in). Their template structure isn't so much a concern rather than an obstacle to overcome, which can be achieved with a fun gimmick of some sort, or, simply, by hitting the comedic marks. If this genre wants to see its resurgence these points are vital, and last year's NO HARD FEELINGS was eager to prove that, a return to form yet still raunchy and imbued with a surprising air of maturity - and even when the jokes didn't land, there was still enjoyment to be found in the excellent(ly cast) leads. ANYONE BUT YOU is as back-to-basics as it could get and appears to be, to a certain extent, aware of that, though here the drive to still be its own thing is completely absent. What immediately stands out is the central 'do-they, don't-they', which pretty much feeds directly into the classic plot structure and is barely taken advantage of. When it is being used for comedic purposes, it easily produces the highlights of the film, like the view/spider scene. Most of this, though, is by-the-numbers and safe, lacking any edge or remarkable features aside from the leads' sex appeal (on that front, the quality of the casting is equal to NO HARD FEELINGS). Speaking of them, Powell is as fun as expected - he would most likely be a solid movie star if the current Hollywood system allowed for those - but Sweeney? No clue what she's doing with those line reads, constantly sounding like a bad impression of an American high school girl with a ready disinterest in everything. Not that she has that much to work with anyway, as the script suffers from eye-rollers of jokes, that first half especially bursting with ""did I just say that out loud?"" humor. My sold out screening was awfully silent through most of this, though maybe they were just there for the aforementioned hotties. Just so you know: you don't get a (proper) view of Sweeney's melons, but you do get to see a squeezed Australian glans. 4/10."
"Anyone But You","jaynzsarah-561-359737","10 February 2024",110,"Launch a cannon to your head.This is one of the worst films I have ever had the misfortune to watch. I could feel my brain cells dying as I watched this absolute mess of a rom-com.Sydney Sweeney was horrible and has all but ruined her career. She could not make any part of her character believable. Very hard to watch.I'm embarrassed for Brian brown for having anything to do with this movie. He couldn't save this film from disaster.The script jumped all over the place and was so completely unrealistic... not once did the film make me believe any part of it could happen.The film relies on poor humour, And, what they don't show you in the commercials is that it's full of far-left LGBTQ propaganda.I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy."
"Anyone But You","ethanbresnett","6 January 2024",710,"Anyone But You caught me a little bit by surprise I must say. Perhaps that's because my expectations were quite low, but they really needn't have been as this film is a really solid romcom.Primarily this comes from Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney. A romcom lives and dies by its romantic leads, and they are both great in this, nailing the weird and evolving chemistry between their two characters. They are each decently well written, feeling believable and engaging.On top of this, there is a fairly forgettable but perfectly pleasant assortment of supporting characters who add some extra levels of humour to the piece.Speaking of humour, it is a bit hit and miss in this film. There aren't many big laughs, but it is amusing and does have a light and goofy tone throughout that is befitting of any romcom.Now, this film doesn't really reinvent the wheel in any way. It has all the same story beats as most romcoms and doesn't take too many risks. Therefore the plot is fairly mediocre and (as with practically all romcoms) is far too predictable. This never really gets in the way of the fun though, but the inevitable ending does make it feel a teensy bit too long.Overall though I think this is a really solid film. It has a good tone, a couple of engaging leads, and will give you a few laughs too."
"Anyone But You","tm-sheehan","5 January 2024",610,"My Review. Anyone But You
My Rating. 6:10Very very loosely based on Shakespeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"" with even a few quotations in the background and title cards this pleasant enough rom com reminds me of a line from a 16 th Century play The Merchant of Venice by same William Shakespeare, ""All that glisters is not gold"".Which of course translates in today's language ""All that glitters is not gold "".Anyone But You has a pleasant cast set in and around Sydney which is fun to spot locations like the QVB building, and our beautiful harbour vistas and pristine beaches.I was reminded of a far superior Classic romantic comedy ""My Best Friend's Wedding "" 1997 when I saw the actor playing the brides father Dermot Mulroney who achieved great success playing a similar lead 26 years ago to Glen Powell who plays Ben the romantic lead man in this movie.I enjoyed both the young leads Sydney Sweeney who plays Bea and Glen Powell who play the star crossed lovers .The differences and similarities for me in great romance comedies with weddings like My Best Friends Wedding and more recently Crazy Rich Asians is obvious they all look fabulous with surroundings that celebrate the affluence of wealthy privileged people .Where they differ from each other is in the quality of the script writing in this case by Ilana Wolpert and Will Gluck.Light comedy can be clever if it's not pretentious why try and improve on Shakespeare? It's an impossible task.Anyone But You is entertaining but parts of it I found really irritating and contrived.Adding a same sex wedding was a nice modern touch but it's the most heterosexual same sex wedding I've ever seen not one Gay in this village except Claudia and Halle the betrothed couple.The most irritating characters for me were the parents of the brides played by Dermot Mulroney, Rachel Griffiths, Bryan Brown and Michelle Hurd they all seemed to be trying to hard .I can't be to critical of this light comedy that probably appeals to a younger audience demographic than myself .I hope it succeeds overseas as we need to export more home grown cinema product from Australia but we can't just rely on great scenery and cute animal platitudes like winking koalas ."
"Anyone But You","psxexperten","9 February 2024",110,"Horrible, don't waste your time
Weak story, unnecessarily extensive vulgar language, and excessive nudity humiliates the actors. Embarrassing movie that degrades men and women and shows no imagination. It is very sad to believe that this movie appeals to people. Downright stupid with no redeeming qualities.I had respect for some of these actors before I watched this movie. All I can say is that perhaps they will do anything for money. I cannot see any other reason to have participated in this film and I am scared for any teenagers or young adults that are entertained by showing off your body and acting like adolescent fools."
"Anyone But You","movieman6-413-929510","5 January 2024",510,"Anyone But You is a new romantic comedy directed, written and produced in part by Will Gluck, director of Easy A and Friends with Benefits.Bea (Sydney Sweeney) and Ben (Glen Powell) haven't seen each other since a first date. When they are both invited to the same wedding, the two meet again.They learn that people are trying to hook them up so they don't cause further problems during the wedding. This is why they pretend, to get rid of the fuss.Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell have good chemistry together in the film and both know how to play well and playfully with and against each other. Despite their chemistry, the overall film is unfortunately more on the standard side of a romantic comedy. This gives the film game its well-known and predictable sides. Other moments come across as a bit too forced. For co-writer Ilana Wolpert, this is only her first written film story.Another downside of the film is the amount of extra characters. Many of these extras bring their own kind of comedy, but otherwise have little real use in the film. With a few fewer of these extras, the film could have been better focused, with a shorter running time."

"Anyone But You","alyetc","28 December 2023",510,"We've seen a million movies set at weddings before - where even the couple getting married gets invested in the main couples status. So I knew a lot of the tropes would be the same, but it was the same but a bit worse. The main couple story I actually really liked, I thought they were hilarious and cute and beat out other movies with the same storyline. It was everything else that fell short. The background characters felt cheesy and fake. All surface level gags or you didn't really get to know them, nothing felt genuine - case in point Bea's parents were incredibly unrealistic, no ones that out of touch. Even Bea's background felt half-done, never explaining why she didn't want law school."

Its repetitive and cliché romantic comedy storyline lacked originality, leaving the audience unengaged. The attempts at humor fell flat, resulting in a tedious and cringe-worthy viewing experience. To add to the disappointment, the lead actress's annoying voice only added to the overall lackluster quality of the film, making it a forgettable and uninspiring cinematic endeavor. Terrible acting and story. I don't understand the high rating of this movie, or the hype. Save your time and skip this one. The movie is downright horrible, with uncomfortable scenes that make you question their choices. Shame on them for delivering such a poorly written script, leading to an overall disappointing and regrettable cinematic experience."
"Anyone But You","barbett-1","1 January 2024",510,"Neither brilliant nor dreadful, ""Anyone But You"" features a cast of characters that are unbelievably attractive and, apparently, insanely wealthy. It stars Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeny's breasts in the formulatic equivalent of a Hallmark Movie knock-off. You know the drill - two perfect young people meet, are instantly attracted to each other, are separated by a misunderstanding with hilarious hijinks ensuing. The misunderstanding is eventually resolved, love blooms once more, and all ends well.What sets this film apart is excellent cinematography with lovely wide-angle views of the Australian countryside. The supporting cast is very capable although the Australian men are played as oafish stereotypes. Glen Powell plays his part well, but Sydney Sweeny appears to be reading her lines from a teleprompter offscreen. Not the worst movie out this holiday season and enjoyable as long as you refrain from high expectations."
"Anyone But You","pkertes-59666","5 January 2024",410,"I went to see this movie because I am a sucker for a romantic comedy, even the average ones (and let's face it, most of them are). Having seen the trailer, I had low expectations, yet this film still managed to come it at an even lower level.Boy meets girl, they hit it off briefly, there is a misunderstanding and when they reconnect through a friend/family wedding, they hate each other. Except as anyone could predict, ultimately they don't really, but it takes an eternity of inauthentic, puerile dross to get there. No tissues needed here.The acting is generally average to poor, and local actors like Rachel Griffiths and Bryan Brown (much of it filmed in Australia) do the minimum required, and are completely wasted here. The script is juvenile, facile and has little in common with reality. The direction is pedestrian and much of the movie is a travel ad for Sydney. Throw in plastic, unlikeable characters and a healthy dose of gratuitous nudity. The attempts at comedy are almost laughable as that, and what little romance eventuates at the end fails to convince after nearly two hours of tripe beforehand.Not recommended, even if you are a fan of the genre."
"Anyone But You","trinaboice","8 January 2024",410,"IN A NUTSHELL:
After an amazing first date, Bea and Ben's fiery attraction turns ice-cold until they find themselves unexpectedly reunited at a destination wedding in Australia that their exes also attend. So, they do what any two mature adults would do: pretend to be a couple amidst the fighting.The film was directed by Will Gluck, who also wrote it with Ilana Wolpert.Ultimately, this is like a rated R Hallmark movie with lots of raunch.THINGS I LIKED:
There is plenty of eye candy here for everyone. The cast is filled with good-looking people and includes Sydney Sweeney, Glen Powell, Alexandra Shipp, Hadley Robinson, GaTa, Michelle Hurd, Dermot Mulroney, Rachel Griffiths, Bryan Brown, and more.Sydney Sweeney was bit by a spider in the movie while filming. That famous clip was posted online and got a lot of stir.We get to visit Australia during the film.The cast is diverse, offering a variety of stories about romance and love.The last scene takes clips from the whole movie and has all of the actors sing the same song for a feel-good moment.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Sure, everyone in the cast is hot, but the script is garbage. It sounded like it was written by a trashy version of Chat GPT.It's supposed to be funny, but it's pathetic how they are instantly super ugly and mean-spirited to each other when they have a miscommunication.It's SUPER predictable.Cliched end-of-movie singing, dancing scene.So much fighting.So many awkward moments.They say the movie is loosely based on Shakepeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"", but I think the Bard would be disgusted by the lack of intelligent language in the script. So many F-bombs. One similarity is that they get a wedding cake from a shop called ""Dogberry's"", which is the name of a character in the play.I cringed and rolled my eyes so many times.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
This movie is definitely not appropriate for kids. It portrays unhealthy relationships and extremely bad behavior.Kids will be completely bored because it's mostly adults talking to each other.Profanity and lots of F-bombs
A lesbian couple kisses and gets married
We see a topless woman
We see several shirtless men
A couple gropes each other inside their shorts.Two women wear bikini tops that barely cover anything.We see a ton of cleavage
A lot of sexual innuendo. We see an unmarried couple in the shower and bed together.We see two men smoke a joint.!"
"Anyone But You","ambusched94","31 December 2023",210,"A forgettable, expendable rom-com where all the somewhat funny, shock value scenes are exposed in the theatrical trailer and there is hardly any laugh-out-loud scenes in this film overall.While Glen Powell has the comedy chops and romantic charm for this film genre, to my astonishment it's the EXACT OPPOSITE for Sydney Sweeney. Her line delivery is dull and she has the same facial expressions, blank stare, dead eyes for most scenes in Anyone But You. You can tell she's acting as in she's not embodying the character in the story and she's simply reading the lines, not conveying any natural nuances in her character each time she does this. Sweeney's crying scene in the taxi felt unnaturally forced. I was surprised her acting was half-a**ed, whereas in the TV series Euphoria (2019-present) her acting feels natural. Or highly likely that she's a limited-range, one-note actress that can only do dark, coming-of-age drama genre and fails at rom-com. IMO, Powell and Sweeney had the most chemistry when their characters were arguing and hating each other. When they got all lovey dovey, the on-screen chemistry felt forced and it was lacking that romantic spark between their characters. I was not invested enough in their progressing relationship to care once they officially got together in the end.So one, I feel like Sweeney largely ruins the film with her bland acting and line delivery, and lack of emotiveness. A better choice for the lead actress in this film should've been a comedic actress or an actress who can deftly juggle comedic timing and dramatic, emotional scenes. If this film was made and released in the 2000s decade for example, Amanda Bynes would be a prime choice for the role of Bea. And two, the character development is lacking and backstory are just tacked-on but don't add any characterization substance. The screenplay pushes the two characters to meet instantaneously at the start of the film, so viewers don't get any individual scenes of each lead character beforehand leaving a lot of character backstory nonexistent. The screenplay gives a brief overlay of each of Ben's and Bea's backstory in a scene montage and it's the error of telling over showing, and it doesn't work, leaving a rushed characterization of both characters that cheapens the film.Supporting characters feel like caricatures and don't add anything to the story. No supporting character was memorable. Some corny dialogue and meta rom-com instances that seem shoehorned in. Also, I wish Darren Barnet (Paxton from the TV series Never Have I Ever (2020-2023)) had more scenes, dialogue and that he would've been the guy Bea ended up with if there was an unexpected surprise, twist ending, instead of the ""enemies to lovers"" and ""stuck together so they'll end up together"" overused romance tropes. But the screenplay is too safe and screenwriters would never be bold enough to rise up to a different, atypical ending like this.I did like that the majority of the film was set in Australia and a few of the songs used in the film's soundtrack.It's ironic that Dermot Mulroney and Rachel Griffiths are in this sucky rom-com when blasting back to the past to 1997, both Mulroney (as the leading man and love interest) and Griffiths (in a supporting role) starred in a first rate quality rom-com, My Best Friend's Wedding. This is why most of my fave rom-coms are from the '90s and the 2000s. When quality storytelling, chemistry, and character development reigned in comparison to this current rom-com garbage.Anyone But You is a derivative, formulaic rom-com that's ultimately unmemorable, vapid rom-com plot, and a waste of time. Just casually watch it once it comes out on streaming if you have nothing else to watch and don't care about draining 1 hour 43 minutes of your time."
"Anyone But You","dogonlion","10 February 2024",110,"Everything in this movie feels forced. The comedy is like ""please laugh, please laugh"". I guess that works on some. Nothing flows naturally. The way they love at first sight and all of the sudden start bickering is unrealistic. The bickering is annoying. Sydney Sweeney is a really good actress, I really liked her in The White Lotus, but she's hasn't been in a movie that uses her full potential yet. The movie is full of cliches. It even has the funny black friend with no love life. I'm really shocked by how much money this movie made.

I also enjoyed dermot mulroney's character when he was learning how to dive and the reoccurance of that at the end of the movie.

"Anyone But You","masonsaul","30 December 2023",710,"Anyone But You is an enjoyably cynical rom com that still has plenty of heartfelt romance at its centre. Just getting one of these theatrically released currently is kind of a miracle and it plays squarely to the genre's strengths. All its beats are predictable in the best way.Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell are on their way to becoming genuine movie stars and this film only further solidifies that. The constant barbs they send each other's way for the majority of the film are really funny and the chemistry they're constantly trying to deny has a real spark to it.This isn't Will Gluck's first rom com and that's apparent in the good ways. The broad physical comedy is balanced nicely by the snappy wit interspersed throughout and it's surprisingly epic (a lot more helicopter stuff than expected). A good soundtrack always helps with this genre and the one here nails it."
"Anyone But You","Remmuchan","27 December 2023",310,"I cannot for the life of me understand how this ended up being a movie shown in theaters. I went into this having no idea what the movie was about. I can now say that I wish I never even bothered to purchase a ticket to see this atrocity. It was the biggest waste of my time ever.I cannot tell you how many times I cringed watching this and how many times I wanted it to just end. The acting was AWFUL, especially from the lead actress who tried so hard to act seductive but it just came off as terrible. Everything about this movie made no sense. The plot line was awful. It felt like watching a really cheesy Netflix rom-com but a hundred times worse. The shocking nude scenes just added to its awfulness.I can't get over how bad this is and I really think they just wanted to make something to tick all the boxes of what a rom-com is except it did not tick any of those boxes at all. Terrible acting, terrible movie, terrible plot line, terrible directing, terrible EVERYTHING.I HATED this movie. Avoid at all costs."
"Anyone But You","MichaelByTheSea","26 December 2023",910,"This was like an R rated raunchy Hallmark movie where people actually have sex. I can do without the miscommunication trope that drove apart a couple that seemed to be connecting, but I enjoyed the banter and really enjoyed the stars.""Serious"" critics typically don't appreciate the rom-com genre and judge them harshly. I went with my adult children and we all loved the movie. My kids make fun of my love for Hallmark movies, but even they liked this one. We laughed out loud repeatedly and walked out smiling. I love that feeling.Sure, the script is flawed, the plot's ridiculous, and some of the dialogue is a bit off, but Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney light up the screen with their amazing chemistry. They're extraordinary specimens and look like they spend 6 hours a day in the gym, but I also like them as actors. Glen Powell was really good in another enjoyable modern rom-com with Zoey Deutch called ""Set It Up"" and he's fearless here, especially with the over the top body humor.Sydney Sweeney is certainly voluptuous, and gorgeous to look at, but she's also established herself as a great actress in more critic friendly shows like ""Euphoria"" and ""White Lotus"". Edgy and dark is fine, and it certainly gets taken more seriously by the critics, but I prefer getting lost in an escapist rom-com that doesn't involve terrible people doing terrible things.I want more of this."

But they are heartwarming and cute!Teens should have more movies like this!Us adults, we're craving for good old style romantic comedies.I hope Hollywood will keep making more and more of these!The chemistry was very good between main characters! The colors of the movie... The vibe throughout entire movie! I enjoyed it.It's a seven from me cause I desperately need more movies like this.Thank you creators for finally making us happy! 😊"
"Anyone But You","NatKaminska","28 December 2023",110,"I need to warn those of you who want to spend your money on this thing: don't do it, not worth it. I watched the movie and it was horrible. It tried to be a charming '90s and '2000s rom-com, yet it failed in every department except with the male lead. Glen Powell is the only good thing about this movie.'Anyone but you' is full of cliches and while you can do cliches in a good way, and make genuine, great gem of a specific genre, this is not the case here. The movie is boring, shallow, cringe comedy with typical cringe, over-the-top, not-funny jokes, maybe 1 joke lands in the entire movie, that's how bad it is. The supposedly 'hilarious' nude scene on the cliff, especially the part when Powell is bending over, completely naked, holding his balls in his hands, is the next level of cringe, nothing funny, nothing charming, just cringe, awkward, awful. It's also full of heavy, not subtle, and obvious cultural references as if the writers just wrote down popular internet memes. Man, these writers really don't have any respect for the viewers. I basically wanted to walk out of this movie after the first 15 minutes.The romance part is badly done as well. The chemistry is average at best, just like a normal chemistry between two beautiful people - they are easy on the eyes oh right, like most people in this industry, but nothing more. They are not Mulder and Scully or Hanks and Ryan. Another problem with the main couple is that only Powell is to some degree likable, even tho the script doesn't make his character particularly likable, Powell's natural charisma and charm do the trick. With Sweeney that doesn't exist, she is utterly unlikeable as Bea, and this flaw kills the romance and fun completely. Despite what was said about this duo during the last summer and what some of their blind stans and the media still say now, they don't fit together as a rom-com couple at all!The screenplay itself doesn't help the actors achieve any chemistry, as the entire story is incredibly predictable, and thus boring, with awful dialogues and wooden acting most of the time.Nothing really happens in this movie! Any romantic comedy has to have some stakes in the relationship, some solid drama, and funny, unexpected twists and turns that make sense at least in the fictional universe. In this movie, the conflict that starts Ben and Bea's feud doesn't even make sense! Literally, one minute of simple explanation would clear the air between them, as they are visibly attracted to each other, from the first moment they meet. So the whole basis of this film, that they hate each other, doesn't make sense. We needed some stronger reason for the hate here.Yes, I'm aware that this movie is based on Shakespeare's play 'Much Ado About Nothing', and that one point of that play is that a great fuss/drama between the protagonists started from something insignificant ('nothing'), but every artist, and not only an artist but average person, knows that film is a completely different medium than a theater play, and what worked in a play about romance, written in Shakespeare's times, doesn't work as well in a modern, romantic comedy film. This movie isn't written intelligently enough to make it work either. Again, for the plot to be compelling in this film, we needed a stronger reason for hatred between the main characters, and the development of the characters, and we got neither of those things. Throughout the film, the characters are basic sketches, and we don't know much about them till the end.Then, during the next two, remaining acts of the movie, also nothing really happens. They decide to fake that they are together out of the blue, and their reasons for it are also simply not good enough for the audience to care about the characters and the story. Throughout the entire film, we don't see at all that Ben genuinely desires his ex, and Bea's parents don't have enough of the presence, are completely flat, insignificant characters for the audience to believe or care that she needs to lie to them, which were the two main reasons for the masquerade. Therefore, another giant flaw of the script: the motivations of the main characters that are supposed to push the plot forward are insufficient to be credible and interesting to the audience.In general, the problem is that nothing is fleshed out in 'Anyone but You' - not the main storyline, not the two main leads, not the background characters, drama, or comedy.The 'meta' lines in the script, the kinda 'wink- wink we know it's typical rom-com trope' also don't work because for this to work, the entire script would have to be much more intelligent and satirical, and it isn't smart or a satire at all! It just tried to cheat the audience by doing this, or the writers gave themselves an easy excuse for the rest of their bad writing, and again - it doesn't work. Nothing works in this movie.Yet another big problem: Sydney doesn't have a talent for comedy, sorry. Her delivery is very bland and too stiff, her character is flat, like cut out of a cardboard figure. I just don't understand how someone like her could get the role specifically in romantic comedy if she doesn't fit this role at all. Weren't there some other, better, and actually comedy-talented, cute actresses available during the casting process? Or was it just an easy money grab because it is Sydney Sweeney from 'Euphoria'?Glen is the only one who can be genuinely hilarious and gives his all, and that is not a surprise for anyone who follows his career. Glen already showed his comedy talent in Scream Queens but also proved it as Hangman in Top Gun. He is a very funny guy in real life too, as you can see in his interviews, so it's obvious comedy is natural for him. That's why he absolutely is in his element in this movie, and he 'feels it' but the problem is no one of the rest of the cast is, including Sydney. And Glen alone is still not good enough to save this movie.When you have such a difference in comedic chops between two leads in a romantic comedy that is a giant problem. I don't know if you noticed, but the hilarious thing is, you can already see in the trailers, that Sydney is not good at all in this movie. I remember that I commented her delivery is terrible the minute I watched the trailer!After I watched this movie, I definitely think Glen is much better in romantic comedies when paired with Zoey Deutch. Glen has a way better, more organic, and natural chemistry with Zoey than with Sydney, maybe because Zoey has a comedy talent just like Glen. I saw on Glen's IMDB that he is going to star in another comedy with Zoey, hopefully, better written than this one, so I will wait for it.To sum up, 'Anyone but You' is not worth one second of your time, your money, or any buzz, just wait for the the movie to appear on the streaming platforms. It doesn't have the great main couple, it doesn't have good background characters, it doesn't have the charm, wit, and natural flow that romantic comedies of the '90s or early '2000 had, like She's All That, Love Actually, Holiday, 10 Things I Hate About You, or How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.It simply doesn't have good or even decent writing! And I'm not the enemy of romantic comedies, I'm a woman and aspiring filmmaker, I love great romantic comedies just like any other great movie, of any other genre. But this movie is so bad, that I genuinely felt ashamed while watching it - I felt ashamed for the filmmakers who made this, especially the writers. Don't bother!"
"Anyone But You","SnoopyStyle","24 February 2024",610,"Bea (Sydney Sweeney) meets Ben (Glen Powell) in a coffee shop and they hook up. There are misunderstandings next morning and they leave angry. It turns out that his friend is marrying her sister. The two enemies have to attend a destination wedding in Australia.Sweeney and Powell are trying all kind of broad physical humor. They are both gorgeous and both have good charisma. Neither are outright comedians and that is important. They are mildly funny but are rarely the funniest part. The first big laugh is the WTF old guy while the two bicker. The butt grabbing scene kinda works, but the leads may be overshadowed by a koala. This duo tries very hard. It's so ridiculous that it's mildly funny."
"Anyone But You","johnnymonsarrat","3 February 2024",410,"Hello again, fellow film travelers.I have to wonder what happened to the writing of this movie. There are some interesting and touching twists to the plot. But mainly it seems plot driven, not character driven. Characters don't make consistent choices with their personality or logic, for example what happens with the parents at the end.The male lead has an acting style that's full of confidence, but he's supposed to be a comic figure that has disabling phobias. God knows why he can barely swim but he can teach diving.The female lead, I take no pleasure in saying this, tends to speak at the other actors instead of to them.I get that the writers were trying to go for a Shakespeare type of thing, like Much Ado About Nothing, but the movie simply wasn't comedic enough to have unconvincing character choices. You can get away with a lot of goofy stuff in a slapstick comedy. But this had mostly drama. So the characters need to make sense.I am sorry. I really wanted to like this.There were hints of genius. There was some good physical comedy and a few touchimg moments. But the cringe worthy flaws buried them."
"Anyone But You","gerrgrady-86307","27 December 2023",210,"My husband and I chose this movie as a Saturday treat. We left around the halfway mark because I kept hoping that it would improve - a waste of time & our weekly movie budget. The actors were given dialog that was juvenile and scene set-ups that were embarrassing. Lots of gratitious nudity and shots of partial nudity. Anyone interested in seeing this movie should just watch the trailer - it gives viewers a good picture of what they'll see at the theater so they don't waste their time sitting through a really bad movie. It was great seeing Bryan Brown but I wish he had chosen a better vehicle in which to appear than this dreck. I had greater expections for Glen Powell, but then maybe this is the level of his actual talent. Sad."
"Anyone But You","DeanAmythe","4 January 2024",410,"Never been into romcoms all that much (I watch movies alone all day as a true cinglephile), though I acknowledge their importance in filling the void for comfort watches: predictable, feel-good, and just the right amount of schmaltz - perfect for a night out (or in). Their template structure isn't so much a concern rather than an obstacle to overcome, which can be achieved with a fun gimmick of some sort, or, simply, by hitting the comedic marks. If this genre wants to see its resurgence these points are vital, and last year's NO HARD FEELINGS was eager to prove that, a return to form yet still raunchy and imbued with a surprising air of maturity - and even when the jokes didn't land, there was still enjoyment to be found in the excellent(ly cast) leads. ANYONE BUT YOU is as back-to-basics as it could get and appears to be, to a certain extent, aware of that, though here the drive to still be its own thing is completely absent. What immediately stands out is the central 'do-they, don't-they', which pretty much feeds directly into the classic plot structure and is barely taken advantage of. When it is being used for comedic purposes, it easily produces the highlights of the film, like the view/spider scene. Most of this, though, is by-the-numbers and safe, lacking any edge or remarkable features aside from the leads' sex appeal (on that front, the quality of the casting is equal to NO HARD FEELINGS). Speaking of them, Powell is as fun as expected - he would most likely be a solid movie star if the current Hollywood system allowed for those - but Sweeney? No clue what she's doing with those line reads, constantly sounding like a bad impression of an American high school girl with a ready disinterest in everything. Not that she has that much to work with anyway, as the script suffers from eye-rollers of jokes, that first half especially bursting with ""did I just say that out loud?"" humor. My sold out screening was awfully silent through most of this, though maybe they were just there for the aforementioned hotties. Just so you know: you don't get a (proper) view of Sweeney's melons, but you do get to see a squeezed Australian glans. 4/10."

I could feel my brain cells dying as I watched this absolute mess of a rom-com.Sydney Sweeney was horrible and has all but ruined her career. She could not make any part of her character believable. Very hard to watch.I'm embarrassed for Brian brown for having anything to do with this movie. He couldn't save this film from disaster.The script jumped all over the place and was so completely unrealistic... not once did the film make me believe any part of it could happen.The film relies on poor humour, And, what they don't show you in the commercials is that it's full of far-left LGBTQ propaganda.I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy."
"Anyone But You","ethanbresnett","6 January 2024",710,"Anyone But You caught me a little bit by surprise I must say. Perhaps that's because my expectations were quite low, but they really needn't have been as this film is a really solid romcom.Primarily this comes from Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney. A romcom lives and dies by its romantic leads, and they are both great in this, nailing the weird and evolving chemistry between their two characters. They are each decently well written, feeling believable and engaging.On top of this, there is a fairly forgettable but perfectly pleasant assortment of supporting characters who add some extra levels of humour to the piece.Speaking of humour, it is a bit hit and miss in this film. There aren't many big laughs, but it is amusing and does have a light and goofy tone throughout that is befitting of any romcom.Now, this film doesn't really reinvent the wheel in any way. It has all the same story beats as most romcoms and doesn't take too many risks. Therefore the plot is fairly mediocre and (as with practically all romcoms) is far too predictable. This never really gets in the way of the fun though, but the inevitable ending does make it feel a teensy bit too long.Overall though I think this is a really solid film. It has a good tone, a couple of engaging leads, and will give you a few laughs too."
"Anyone But You","tm-sheehan","5 January 2024",610,"My Review. Anyone But You
My Rating. 6:10Very very loosely based on Shakespeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"" with even a few quotations in the background and title cards this pleasant enough rom com reminds me of a line from a 16 th Century play The Merchant of Venice by same William Shakespeare, ""All that glisters is not gold"".Which of course translates in today's language ""All that glitters is not gold "".Anyone But You has a pleasant cast set in and around Sydney which is fun to spot locations like the QVB building, and our beautiful harbour vistas and pristine beaches.I was reminded of a far superior Classic romantic comedy ""My Best Friend's Wedding "" 1997 when I saw the actor playing the brides father Dermot Mulroney who achieved great success playing a similar lead 26 years ago to Glen Powell who plays Ben the romantic lead man in this movie.I enjoyed both the young leads Sydney Sweeney who plays Bea and Glen Powell who play the star crossed lovers .The differences and similarities for me in great romance comedies with weddings like My Best Friends Wedding and more recently Crazy Rich Asians is obvious they all look fabulous with surroundings that celebrate the affluence of wealthy privileged people .Where they differ from each other is in the quality of the script writing in this case by Ilana Wolpert and Will Gluck.Light comedy can be clever if it's not pretentious why try and improve on Shakespeare? It's an impossible task.Anyone But You is entertaining but parts of it I found really irritating and contrived.Adding a same sex wedding was a nice modern touch but it's the most heterosexual same sex wedding I've ever seen not one Gay in this village except Claudia and Halle the betrothed couple.The most irritating characters for me were the parents of the brides played by Dermot Mulroney, Rachel Griffiths, Bryan Brown and Michelle Hurd they all seemed to be trying to hard .I can't be to critical of this light comedy that probably appeals to a younger audience demographic than myself .I hope it succeeds overseas as we need to export more home grown cinema product from Australia but we can't just rely on great scenery and cute animal platitudes like winking koalas ."
"Anyone But You","psxexperten","9 February 2024",110,"Horrible, don't waste your time
Weak story, unnecessarily extensive vulgar language, and excessive nudity humiliates the actors. Embarrassing movie that degrades men and women and shows no imagination. It is very sad to believe that this movie appeals to people. Downright stupid with no redeeming qualities.I had respect for some of these actors before I watched this movie. All I can say is that perhaps they will do anything for money. I cannot see any other reason to have participated in this film and I am scared for any teenagers or young adults that are entertained by showing off your body and acting like adolescent fools."
"Anyone But You","movieman6-413-929510","5 January 2024",510,"Anyone But You is a new romantic comedy directed, written and produced in part by Will Gluck, director of Easy A and Friends with Benefits.Bea (Sydney Sweeney) and Ben (Glen Powell) haven't seen each other since a first date. When they are both invited to the same wedding, the two meet again.They learn that people are trying to hook them up so they don't cause further problems during the wedding. This is why they pretend, to get rid of the fuss.Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell have good chemistry together in the film and both know how to play well and playfully with and against each other. Despite their chemistry, the overall film is unfortunately more on the standard side of a romantic comedy. This gives the film game its well-known and predictable sides. Other moments come across as a bit too forced. For co-writer Ilana Wolpert, this is only her first written film story.Another downside of the film is the amount of extra characters. Many of these extras bring their own kind of comedy, but otherwise have little real use in the film. With a few fewer of these extras, the film could have been better focused, with a shorter running time."

Maybe will distract people from her weird acting and that strange way of talking like she has something lodged on her cheeks.Dont waste your money or time in this , go do laundry or try to make that recipe you saved from tik tok.There is a reason they were trying so hard with the promo, EVERYBODY KNEW IT WAS A FLOP."
"Anyone But You","alyetc","28 December 2023",510,"We've seen a million movies set at weddings before - where even the couple getting married gets invested in the main couples status. So I knew a lot of the tropes would be the same, but it was the same but a bit worse. The main couple story I actually really liked, I thought they were hilarious and cute and beat out other movies with the same storyline. It was everything else that fell short. The background characters felt cheesy and fake. All surface level gags or you didn't really get to know them, nothing felt genuine - case in point Bea's parents were incredibly unrealistic, no ones that out of touch. Even Bea's background felt half-done, never explaining why she didn't want law school."

Its repetitive and cliché romantic comedy storyline lacked originality, leaving the audience unengaged. The attempts at humor fell flat, resulting in a tedious and cringe-worthy viewing experience. To add to the disappointment, the lead actress's annoying voice only added to the overall lackluster quality of the film, making it a forgettable and uninspiring cinematic endeavor. Terrible acting and story. I don't understand the high rating of this movie, or the hype. Save your time and skip this one. The movie is downright horrible, with uncomfortable scenes that make you question their choices. Shame on them for delivering such a poorly written script, leading to an overall disappointing and regrettable cinematic experience."
"Anyone But You","barbett-1","1 January 2024",510,"Neither brilliant nor dreadful, ""Anyone But You"" features a cast of characters that are unbelievably attractive and, apparently, insanely wealthy. It stars Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeny's breasts in the formulatic equivalent of a Hallmark Movie knock-off. You know the drill - two perfect young people meet, are instantly attracted to each other, are separated by a misunderstanding with hilarious hijinks ensuing. The misunderstanding is eventually resolved, love blooms once more, and all ends well.What sets this film apart is excellent cinematography with lovely wide-angle views of the Australian countryside. The supporting cast is very capable although the Australian men are played as oafish stereotypes. Glen Powell plays his part well, but Sydney Sweeny appears to be reading her lines from a teleprompter offscreen. Not the worst movie out this holiday season and enjoyable as long as you refrain from high expectations."
"Anyone But You","pkertes-59666","5 January 2024",410,"I went to see this movie because I am a sucker for a romantic comedy, even the average ones (and let's face it, most of them are). Having seen the trailer, I had low expectations, yet this film still managed to come it at an even lower level.Boy meets girl, they hit it off briefly, there is a misunderstanding and when they reconnect through a friend/family wedding, they hate each other. Except as anyone could predict, ultimately they don't really, but it takes an eternity of inauthentic, puerile dross to get there. No tissues needed here.The acting is generally average to poor, and local actors like Rachel Griffiths and Bryan Brown (much of it filmed in Australia) do the minimum required, and are completely wasted here. The script is juvenile, facile and has little in common with reality. The direction is pedestrian and much of the movie is a travel ad for Sydney. Throw in plastic, unlikeable characters and a healthy dose of gratuitous nudity. The attempts at comedy are almost laughable as that, and what little romance eventuates at the end fails to convince after nearly two hours of tripe beforehand.Not recommended, even if you are a fan of the genre."
"Anyone But You","trinaboice","8 January 2024",410,"IN A NUTSHELL:
After an amazing first date, Bea and Ben's fiery attraction turns ice-cold until they find themselves unexpectedly reunited at a destination wedding in Australia that their exes also attend. So, they do what any two mature adults would do: pretend to be a couple amidst the fighting.The film was directed by Will Gluck, who also wrote it with Ilana Wolpert.Ultimately, this is like a rated R Hallmark movie with lots of raunch.THINGS I LIKED:
There is plenty of eye candy here for everyone. The cast is filled with good-looking people and includes Sydney Sweeney, Glen Powell, Alexandra Shipp, Hadley Robinson, GaTa, Michelle Hurd, Dermot Mulroney, Rachel Griffiths, Bryan Brown, and more.Sydney Sweeney was bit by a spider in the movie while filming. That famous clip was posted online and got a lot of stir.We get to visit Australia during the film.The cast is diverse, offering a variety of stories about romance and love.The last scene takes clips from the whole movie and has all of the actors sing the same song for a feel-good moment.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Sure, everyone in the cast is hot, but the script is garbage. It sounded like it was written by a trashy version of Chat GPT.It's supposed to be funny, but it's pathetic how they are instantly super ugly and mean-spirited to each other when they have a miscommunication.It's SUPER predictable.Cliched end-of-movie singing, dancing scene.So much fighting.So many awkward moments.They say the movie is loosely based on Shakepeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"", but I think the Bard would be disgusted by the lack of intelligent language in the script. So many F-bombs. One similarity is that they get a wedding cake from a shop called ""Dogberry's"", which is the name of a character in the play.I cringed and rolled my eyes so many times.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
This movie is definitely not appropriate for kids. It portrays unhealthy relationships and extremely bad behavior.Kids will be completely bored because it's mostly adults talking to each other.Profanity and lots of F-bombs
A lesbian couple kisses and gets married
We see a topless woman
We see several shirtless men
A couple gropes each other inside their shorts.Two women wear bikini tops that barely cover anything.We see a ton of cleavage
A lot of sexual innuendo. We see an unmarried couple in the shower and bed together.We see two men smoke a joint.!"
"Anyone But You","ambusched94","31 December 2023",210,"A forgettable, expendable rom-com where all the somewhat funny, shock value scenes are exposed in the theatrical trailer and there is hardly any laugh-out-loud scenes in this film overall.While Glen Powell has the comedy chops and romantic charm for this film genre, to my astonishment it's the EXACT OPPOSITE for Sydney Sweeney. Her line delivery is dull and she has the same facial expressions, blank stare, dead eyes for most scenes in Anyone But You. You can tell she's acting as in she's not embodying the character in the story and she's simply reading the lines, not conveying any natural nuances in her character each time she does this. Sweeney's crying scene in the taxi felt unnaturally forced. I was surprised her acting was half-a**ed, whereas in the TV series Euphoria (2019-present) her acting feels natural. Or highly likely that she's a limited-range, one-note actress that can only do dark, coming-of-age drama genre and fails at rom-com. IMO, Powell and Sweeney had the most chemistry when their characters were arguing and hating each other. When they got all lovey dovey, the on-screen chemistry felt forced and it was lacking that romantic spark between their characters. I was not invested enough in their progressing relationship to care once they officially got together in the end.So one, I feel like Sweeney largely ruins the film with her bland acting and line delivery, and lack of emotiveness. A better choice for the lead actress in this film should've been a comedic actress or an actress who can deftly juggle comedic timing and dramatic, emotional scenes. If this film was made and released in the 2000s decade for example, Amanda Bynes would be a prime choice for the role of Bea. And two, the character development is lacking and backstory are just tacked-on but don't add any characterization substance. The screenplay pushes the two characters to meet instantaneously at the start of the film, so viewers don't get any individual scenes of each lead character beforehand leaving a lot of character backstory nonexistent. The screenplay gives a brief overlay of each of Ben's and Bea's backstory in a scene montage and it's the error of telling over showing, and it doesn't work, leaving a rushed characterization of both characters that cheapens the film.Supporting characters feel like caricatures and don't add anything to the story. No supporting character was memorable. Some corny dialogue and meta rom-com instances that seem shoehorned in. Also, I wish Darren Barnet (Paxton from the TV series Never Have I Ever (2020-2023)) had more scenes, dialogue and that he would've been the guy Bea ended up with if there was an unexpected surprise, twist ending, instead of the ""enemies to lovers"" and ""stuck together so they'll end up together"" overused romance tropes. But the screenplay is too safe and screenwriters would never be bold enough to rise up to a different, atypical ending like this.I did like that the majority of the film was set in Australia and a few of the songs used in the film's soundtrack.It's ironic that Dermot Mulroney and Rachel Griffiths are in this sucky rom-com when blasting back to the past to 1997, both Mulroney (as the leading man and love interest) and Griffiths (in a supporting role) starred in a first rate quality rom-com, My Best Friend's Wedding. This is why most of my fave rom-coms are from the '90s and the 2000s. When quality storytelling, chemistry, and character development reigned in comparison to this current rom-com garbage.Anyone But You is a derivative, formulaic rom-com that's ultimately unmemorable, vapid rom-com plot, and a waste of time. Just casually watch it once it comes out on streaming if you have nothing else to watch and don't care about draining 1 hour 43 minutes of your time."
"Anyone But You","dogonlion","10 February 2024",110,"Everything in this movie feels forced. The comedy is like ""please laugh, please laugh"". I guess that works on some. Nothing flows naturally. The way they love at first sight and all of the sudden start bickering is unrealistic. The bickering is annoying. Sydney Sweeney is a really good actress, I really liked her in The White Lotus, but she's hasn't been in a movie that uses her full potential yet. The movie is full of cliches. It even has the funny black friend with no love life. I'm really shocked by how much money this movie made. I guess as long as those kinds of movies make money they'll keep the same formula and keep factory produce them and soon will use artificial intelligence to write them."

It had some cute scenes. I gotta say the ensemble was pretty good if I laughed it was always because something one of them said. They were a bunch of goofy characters. I also enjoyed dermot mulroney's character when he was learning how to dive and the reoccurance of that at the end of the movie.

Overall, an incredibly formulaic Rom-Com that tries way too hard to capitalize on the popularity and looks of Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney, but fails hard as it is so predictable and barely funny.Bad Direction (The whole movie just feels like the studio shelled out something to tick boxes rather than make a well thought-out comedy (this included plot concepts, wardrobing, and jokes) because that's what they think the audience 'wants' as they try too hard to be 'modern,' meaning the director couldn't make any creative decisions; the direction on both a macro and microscale feels very formulaic to other Rom-Coms; the direction of actors is very bad as he does not establish any chemistry for the cast as all the performances feel mundane and toneless; the storytelling is a formulaic and predictable Rom-Com), Bad Acting (Bad to Pretty Bad from Sydney Sweeney (The overall performance feels mundane and toneless and she fails to establish any chemistry with Glen Powell, but she does have some moments where she does a decent to pretty good job), Decent to Pretty Good from Glen Powell (The only positive performance in the movie as he holds his own and leads the movie well as a Rom-Com lead (it's just the material is so bad he can only do so much)), Decent from Alexandra Shipp (Actually holds her own well and shows some a little range (which is a lot given this movie)), Bad from GaTa (Cannot match the levels of any of the other actors and feels very toneless with little effort), Pretty Bad from Hadley Robinson (Just doesn't offer anything), Decent from Michelle Hurd (Shows some experience and decent timing), Decent from Dermot Mulroney (Has some charisma and timing), Decent from Charlee Fraser (The most surprising performance of the movie as she holds her own fairly well and establishes some charm and chemistry with Glen Powell), Very Bad from the rest of the cast (Just a lot of toneless and stereotypical Rom-Com performances; there is no chemistry in the entire cast)), Very Bad Story (The concept is a modern retelling of Shakespeare's 'Much Ado About Nothing,' but it does not do anything to be unique as it just follows the cookie cutter Rom-Com plot (mixed with forced modern references); the story construction is incredibly formulaic as each scene is incredibly predictable on what is going to happen and where it is going to go; because the movie is so predictable, there is a flow because it just follows this boilerplate to a tea; the character writing is terrible as all the characters as so shallow and stereotypical to Rom-Coms (and things are brought up for characters that never get addressed or add more depth to the characters)), Very Bad Screenplay (The dialogue is atrocious and very predictable (the movie forces in so many modern references that it just feels like they are pandering to the youth rather than writing realistic dialogue); the joke hit rate is probably 1 out of every 5 jokes (and some of the jokes are just so stupid that its cringe at how they even made this movie); the symbolism is incredibly overt (with the quotes from the source material and the messages of the story being overlaid onto the screen); the foreshadowing is incredibly overt that it makes the movie incredibly predictable), Decent Score; Decent Soundtrack (Did enjoy the songs they chose), Pretty Good Cinematography (Very polished as you could tell the studio put in a lot of money to make this movie), Pretty Bad Sound (Some of the sound effects are just off from what happened), Decent Editing (The actual edit was very polished and felt like it had a big budget; the cut for the movie just feels weird as it is obvious where they did reshoots and what was originally shot), Good Costumes (They made a very conscious decision with what each character was wearing to get people to watch this movie (and I respect that)), Plot Structure followed the source material's and Rom-Com template to a tee (which made the movie incredibly formulaic and predictable), Pacing was decent (as it kept the Rom-Com pace), Climax was so forced and incredibly formulaic (which made me cringe very hard when watching this movie), Tone was very similar to other Rom-Coms (especially from the early 2010s), It was so obvious where there were reshoots for this movie as some of the scenes were so bad and some were more tolerable."
"Anyone But You","masonsaul","30 December 2023",710,"Anyone But You is an enjoyably cynical rom com that still has plenty of heartfelt romance at its centre. Just getting one of these theatrically released currently is kind of a miracle and it plays squarely to the genre's strengths. All its beats are predictable in the best way.Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell are on their way to becoming genuine movie stars and this film only further solidifies that. The constant barbs they send each other's way for the majority of the film are really funny and the chemistry they're constantly trying to deny has a real spark to it.This isn't Will Gluck's first rom com and that's apparent in the good ways. The broad physical comedy is balanced nicely by the snappy wit interspersed throughout and it's surprisingly epic (a lot more helicopter stuff than expected). A good soundtrack always helps with this genre and the one here nails it."
"Anyone But You","Remmuchan","27 December 2023",310,"I cannot for the life of me understand how this ended up being a movie shown in theaters. I went into this having no idea what the movie was about. I can now say that I wish I never even bothered to purchase a ticket to see this atrocity. It was the biggest waste of my time ever.I cannot tell you how many times I cringed watching this and how many times I wanted it to just end. The acting was AWFUL, especially from the lead actress who tried so hard to act seductive but it just came off as terrible. Everything about this movie made no sense. The plot line was awful. It felt like watching a really cheesy Netflix rom-com but a hundred times worse. The shocking nude scenes just added to its awfulness.I can't get over how bad this is and I really think they just wanted to make something to tick all the boxes of what a rom-com is except it did not tick any of those boxes at all. Terrible acting, terrible movie, terrible plot line, terrible directing, terrible EVERYTHING.I HATED this movie. Avoid at all costs."
"Anyone But You","MichaelByTheSea","26 December 2023",910,"This was like an R rated raunchy Hallmark movie where people actually have sex. I can do without the miscommunication trope that drove apart a couple that seemed to be connecting, but I enjoyed the banter and really enjoyed the stars.""Serious"" critics typically don't appreciate the rom-com genre and judge them harshly. I went with my adult children and we all loved the movie. My kids make fun of my love for Hallmark movies, but even they liked this one. We laughed out loud repeatedly and walked out smiling. I love that feeling.Sure, the script is flawed, the plot's ridiculous, and some of the dialogue is a bit off, but Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney light up the screen with their amazing chemistry. They're extraordinary specimens and look like they spend 6 hours a day in the gym, but I also like them as actors. Glen Powell was really good in another enjoyable modern rom-com with Zoey Deutch called ""Set It Up"" and he's fearless here, especially with the over the top body humor.Sydney Sweeney is certainly voluptuous, and gorgeous to look at, but she's also established herself as a great actress in more critic friendly shows like ""Euphoria"" and ""White Lotus"". Edgy and dark is fine, and it certainly gets taken more seriously by the critics, but I prefer getting lost in an escapist rom-com that doesn't involve terrible people doing terrible things.I want more of this."

"Anyone But You","NatKaminska","28 December 2023",110,"I need to warn those of you who want to spend your money on this thing: don't do it, not worth it. I watched the movie and it was horrible. It tried to be a charming '90s and '2000s rom-com, yet it failed in every department except with the male lead. Glen Powell is the only good thing about this movie.'Anyone but you' is full of cliches and while you can do cliches in a good way, and make genuine, great gem of a specific genre, this is not the case here. The movie is boring, shallow, cringe comedy with typical cringe, over-the-top, not-funny jokes, maybe 1 joke lands in the entire movie, that's how bad it is. The supposedly 'hilarious' nude scene on the cliff, especially the part when Powell is bending over, completely naked, holding his balls in his hands, is the next level of cringe, nothing funny, nothing charming, just cringe, awkward, awful. It's also full of heavy, not subtle, and obvious cultural references as if the writers just wrote down popular internet memes. Man, these writers really don't have any respect for the viewers. I basically wanted to walk out of this movie after the first 15 minutes.The romance part is badly done as well. The chemistry is average at best, just like a normal chemistry between two beautiful people - they are easy on the eyes oh right, like most people in this industry, but nothing more. They are not Mulder and Scully or Hanks and Ryan. Another problem with the main couple is that only Powell is to some degree likable, even tho the script doesn't make his character particularly likable, Powell's natural charisma and charm do the trick. With Sweeney that doesn't exist, she is utterly unlikeable as Bea, and this flaw kills the romance and fun completely. Despite what was said about this duo during the last summer and what some of their blind stans and the media still say now, they don't fit together as a rom-com couple at all!The screenplay itself doesn't help the actors achieve any chemistry, as the entire story is incredibly predictable, and thus boring, with awful dialogues and wooden acting most of the time.Nothing really happens in this movie! Any romantic comedy has to have some stakes in the relationship, some solid drama, and funny, unexpected twists and turns that make sense at least in the fictional universe. In this movie, the conflict that starts Ben and Bea's feud doesn't even make sense! Literally, one minute of simple explanation would clear the air between them, as they are visibly attracted to each other, from the first moment they meet. So the whole basis of this film, that they hate each other, doesn't make sense. We needed some stronger reason for the hate here.Yes, I'm aware that this movie is based on Shakespeare's play 'Much Ado About Nothing', and that one point of that play is that a great fuss/drama between the protagonists started from something insignificant ('nothing'), but every artist, and not only an artist but average person, knows that film is a completely different medium than a theater play, and what worked in a play about romance, written in Shakespeare's times, doesn't work as well in a modern, romantic comedy film. This movie isn't written intelligently enough to make it work either. Again, for the plot to be compelling in this film, we needed a stronger reason for hatred between the main characters, and the development of the characters, and we got neither of those things. Throughout the film, the characters are basic sketches, and we don't know much about them till the end.Then, during the next two, remaining acts of the movie, also nothing really happens. They decide to fake that they are together out of the blue, and their reasons for it are also simply not good enough for the audience to care about the characters and the story. Throughout the entire film, we don't see at all that Ben genuinely desires his ex, and Bea's parents don't have enough of the presence, are completely flat, insignificant characters for the audience to believe or care that she needs to lie to them, which were the two main reasons for the masquerade. Therefore, another giant flaw of the script: the motivations of the main characters that are supposed to push the plot forward are insufficient to be credible and interesting to the audience.In general, the problem is that nothing is fleshed out in 'Anyone but You' - not the main storyline, not the two main leads, not the background characters, drama, or comedy.The 'meta' lines in the script, the kinda 'wink- wink we know it's typical rom-com trope' also don't work because for this to work, the entire script would have to be much more intelligent and satirical, and it isn't smart or a satire at all! It just tried to cheat the audience by doing this, or the writers gave themselves an easy excuse for the rest of their bad writing, and again - it doesn't work. Nothing works in this movie.Yet another big problem: Sydney doesn't have a talent for comedy, sorry. Her delivery is very bland and too stiff, her character is flat, like cut out of a cardboard figure. I just don't understand how someone like her could get the role specifically in romantic comedy if she doesn't fit this role at all. Weren't there some other, better, and actually comedy-talented, cute actresses available during the casting process? Or was it just an easy money grab because it is Sydney Sweeney from 'Euphoria'?Glen is the only one who can be genuinely hilarious and gives his all, and that is not a surprise for anyone who follows his career. Glen already showed his comedy talent in Scream Queens but also proved it as Hangman in Top Gun. He is a very funny guy in real life too, as you can see in his interviews, so it's obvious comedy is natural for him. That's why he absolutely is in his element in this movie, and he 'feels it' but the problem is no one of the rest of the cast is, including Sydney. And Glen alone is still not good enough to save this movie.When you have such a difference in comedic chops between two leads in a romantic comedy that is a giant problem. I don't know if you noticed, but the hilarious thing is, you can already see in the trailers, that Sydney is not good at all in this movie. I remember that I commented her delivery is terrible the minute I watched the trailer!After I watched this movie, I definitely think Glen is much better in romantic comedies when paired with Zoey Deutch. Glen has a way better, more organic, and natural chemistry with Zoey than with Sydney, maybe because Zoey has a comedy talent just like Glen. I saw on Glen's IMDB that he is going to star in another comedy with Zoey, hopefully, better written than this one, so I will wait for it.To sum up, 'Anyone but You' is not worth one second of your time, your money, or any buzz, just wait for the the movie to appear on the streaming platforms. It doesn't have the great main couple, it doesn't have good background characters, it doesn't have the charm, wit, and natural flow that romantic comedies of the '90s or early '2000 had, like She's All That, Love Actually, Holiday, 10 Things I Hate About You, or How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.It simply doesn't have good or even decent writing! And I'm not the enemy of romantic comedies, I'm a woman and aspiring filmmaker, I love great romantic comedies just like any other great movie, of any other genre. But this movie is so bad, that I genuinely felt ashamed while watching it - I felt ashamed for the filmmakers who made this, especially the writers. Don't bother!"
"Anyone But You","SnoopyStyle","24 February 2024",610,"Bea (Sydney Sweeney) meets Ben (Glen Powell) in a coffee shop and they hook up. There are misunderstandings next morning and they leave angry. It turns out that his friend is marrying her sister. The two enemies have to attend a destination wedding in Australia.Sweeney and Powell are trying all kind of broad physical humor. They are both gorgeous and both have good charisma. Neither are outright comedians and that is important. They are mildly funny but are rarely the funniest part. The first big laugh is the WTF old guy while the two bicker. The butt grabbing scene kinda works, but the leads may be overshadowed by a koala. This duo tries very hard. It's so ridiculous that it's mildly funny."
"Anyone But You","johnnymonsarrat","3 February 2024",410,"Hello again, fellow film travelers.I have to wonder what happened to the writing of this movie. There are some interesting and touching twists to the plot. But mainly it seems plot driven, not character driven. Characters don't make consistent choices with their personality or logic, for example what happens with the parents at the end.The male lead has an acting style that's full of confidence, but he's supposed to be a comic figure that has disabling phobias. God knows why he can barely swim but he can teach diving.The female lead, I take no pleasure in saying this, tends to speak at the other actors instead of to them.I get that the writers were trying to go for a Shakespeare type of thing, like Much Ado About Nothing, but the movie simply wasn't comedic enough to have unconvincing character choices. You can get away with a lot of goofy stuff in a slapstick comedy. But this had mostly drama. So the characters need to make sense.I am sorry. I really wanted to like this.There were hints of genius. There was some good physical comedy and a few touchimg moments. But the cringe worthy flaws buried them."
"Anyone But You","gerrgrady-86307","27 December 2023",210,"My husband and I chose this movie as a Saturday treat. We left around the halfway mark because I kept hoping that it would improve - a waste of time & our weekly movie budget. The actors were given dialog that was juvenile and scene set-ups that were embarrassing. Lots of gratitious nudity and shots of partial nudity. Anyone interested in seeing this movie should just watch the trailer - it gives viewers a good picture of what they'll see at the theater so they don't waste their time sitting through a really bad movie. It was great seeing Bryan Brown but I wish he had chosen a better vehicle in which to appear than this dreck. I had greater expections for Glen Powell, but then maybe this is the level of his actual talent. Sad."
"Anyone But You","DeanAmythe","4 January 2024",410,"Never been into romcoms all that much (I watch movies alone all day as a true cinglephile), though I acknowledge their importance in filling the void for comfort watches: predictable, feel-good, and just the right amount of schmaltz - perfect for a night out (or in). Their template structure isn't so much a concern rather than an obstacle to overcome, which can be achieved with a fun gimmick of some sort, or, simply, by hitting the comedic marks. If this genre wants to see its resurgence these points are vital, and last year's NO HARD FEELINGS was eager to prove that, a return to form yet still raunchy and imbued with a surprising air of maturity - and even when the jokes didn't land, there was still enjoyment to be found in the excellent(ly cast) leads. ANYONE BUT YOU is as back-to-basics as it could get and appears to be, to a certain extent, aware of that, though here the drive to still be its own thing is completely absent. What immediately stands out is the central 'do-they, don't-they', which pretty much feeds directly into the classic plot structure and is barely taken advantage of. When it is being used for comedic purposes, it easily produces the highlights of the film, like the view/spider scene. Most of this, though, is by-the-numbers and safe, lacking any edge or remarkable features aside from the leads' sex appeal (on that front, the quality of the casting is equal to NO HARD FEELINGS). Speaking of them, Powell is as fun as expected - he would most likely be a solid movie star if the current Hollywood system allowed for those - but Sweeney? No clue what she's doing with those line reads, constantly sounding like a bad impression of an American high school girl with a ready disinterest in everything. Not that she has that much to work with anyway, as the script suffers from eye-rollers of jokes, that first half especially bursting with ""did I just say that out loud?"" humor. My sold out screening was awfully silent through most of this, though maybe they were just there for the aforementioned hotties. Just so you know: you don't get a (proper) view of Sweeney's melons, but you do get to see a squeezed Australian glans. 4/10."

I could feel my brain cells dying as I watched this absolute mess of a rom-com.Sydney Sweeney was horrible and has all but ruined her career. She could not make any part of her character believable. Very hard to watch.I'm embarrassed for Brian brown for having anything to do with this movie. He couldn't save this film from disaster.The script jumped all over the place and was so completely unrealistic... not once did the film make me believe any part of it could happen.The film relies on poor humour, And, what they don't show you in the commercials is that it's full of far-left LGBTQ propaganda.I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy."
"Anyone But You","ethanbresnett","6 January 2024",710,"Anyone But You caught me a little bit by surprise I must say. Perhaps that's because my expectations were quite low, but they really needn't have been as this film is a really solid romcom.Primarily this comes from Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney. A romcom lives and dies by its romantic leads, and they are both great in this, nailing the weird and evolving chemistry between their two characters. They are each decently well written, feeling believable and engaging.On top of this, there is a fairly forgettable but perfectly pleasant assortment of supporting characters who add some extra levels of humour to the piece.Speaking of humour, it is a bit hit and miss in this film. There aren't many big laughs, but it is amusing and does have a light and goofy tone throughout that is befitting of any romcom.Now, this film doesn't really reinvent the wheel in any way. It has all the same story beats as most romcoms and doesn't take too many risks. Therefore the plot is fairly mediocre and (as with practically all romcoms) is far too predictable. This never really gets in the way of the fun though, but the inevitable ending does make it feel a teensy bit too long.Overall though I think this is a really solid film. It has a good tone, a couple of engaging leads, and will give you a few laughs too."
"Anyone But You","tm-sheehan","5 January 2024",610,"My Review. Anyone But You
My Rating. 6:10Very very loosely based on Shakespeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"" with even a few quotations in the background and title cards this pleasant enough rom com reminds me of a line from a 16 th Century play The Merchant of Venice by same William Shakespeare, ""All that glisters is not gold"".Which of course translates in today's language ""All that glitters is not gold "".Anyone But You has a pleasant cast set in and around Sydney which is fun to spot locations like the QVB building, and our beautiful harbour vistas and pristine beaches.I was reminded of a far superior Classic romantic comedy ""My Best Friend's Wedding "" 1997 when I saw the actor playing the brides father Dermot Mulroney who achieved great success playing a similar lead 26 years ago to Glen Powell who plays Ben the romantic lead man in this movie.I enjoyed both the young leads Sydney Sweeney who plays Bea and Glen Powell who play the star crossed lovers .The differences and similarities for me in great romance comedies with weddings like My Best Friends Wedding and more recently Crazy Rich Asians is obvious they all look fabulous with surroundings that celebrate the affluence of wealthy privileged people .Where they differ from each other is in the quality of the script writing in this case by Ilana Wolpert and Will Gluck.Light comedy can be clever if it's not pretentious why try and improve on Shakespeare? It's an impossible task.Anyone But You is entertaining but parts of it I found really irritating and contrived.Adding a same sex wedding was a nice modern touch but it's the most heterosexual same sex wedding I've ever seen not one Gay in this village except Claudia and Halle the betrothed couple.The most irritating characters for me were the parents of the brides played by Dermot Mulroney, Rachel Griffiths, Bryan Brown and Michelle Hurd they all seemed to be trying to hard .I can't be to critical of this light comedy that probably appeals to a younger audience demographic than myself .I hope it succeeds overseas as we need to export more home grown cinema product from Australia but we can't just rely on great scenery and cute animal platitudes like winking koalas ."

Weak story, unnecessarily extensive vulgar language, and excessive nudity humiliates the actors. Embarrassing movie that degrades men and women and shows no imagination. It is very sad to believe that this movie appeals to people. Downright stupid with no redeeming qualities.I had respect for some of these actors before I watched this movie. All I can say is that perhaps they will do anything for money.

"Anyone But You","movieman6-413-929510","5 January 2024",510,"Anyone But You is a new romantic comedy directed, written and produced in part by Will Gluck, director of Easy A and Friends with Benefits.Bea (Sydney Sweeney) and Ben (Glen Powell) haven't seen each other since a first date. When they are both invited to the same wedding, the two meet again.They learn that people are trying to hook them up so they don't cause further problems during the wedding. This is why they pretend, to get rid of the fuss.Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell have good chemistry together in the film and both know how to play well and playfully with and against each other. Despite their chemistry, the overall film is unfortunately more on the standard side of a romantic comedy. This gives the film game its well-known and predictable sides. Other moments come across as a bit too forced. For co-writer Ilana Wolpert, this is only her first written film story.Another downside of the film is the amount of extra characters. Many of these extras bring their own kind of comedy, but otherwise have little real use in the film. With a few fewer of these extras, the film could have been better focused, with a shorter running time."

"Anyone But You","alyetc","28 December 2023",510,"We've seen a million movies set at weddings before - where even the couple getting married gets invested in the main couples status. So I knew a lot of the tropes would be the same, but it was the same but a bit worse. The main couple story I actually really liked, I thought they were hilarious and cute and beat out other movies with the same storyline. It was everything else that fell short. The background characters felt cheesy and fake. All surface level gags or you didn't really get to know them, nothing felt genuine - case in point Bea's parents were incredibly unrealistic, no ones that out of touch. Even Bea's background felt half-done, never explaining why she didn't want law school."

To add to the disappointment, the lead actress's annoying voice only added to the overall lackluster quality of the film, making it a forgettable and uninspiring cinematic endeavor. Terrible acting and story. I don't understand the high rating of this movie, or the hype. Save your time and skip this one.

Shame on them for delivering such a poorly written script, leading to an overall disappointing and regrettable cinematic experience."
"Anyone But You","barbett-1","1 January 2024",510,"Neither brilliant nor dreadful, ""Anyone But You"" features a cast of characters that are unbelievably attractive and, apparently, insanely wealthy. It stars Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeny's breasts in the formulatic equivalent of a Hallmark Movie knock-off. You know the drill - two perfect young people meet, are instantly attracted to each other, are separated by a misunderstanding with hilarious hijinks ensuing. The misunderstanding is eventually resolved, love blooms once more, and all ends well.What sets this film apart is excellent cinematography with lovely wide-angle views of the Australian countryside. The supporting cast is very capable although the Australian men are played as oafish stereotypes. Glen Powell plays his part well, but Sydney Sweeny appears to be reading her lines from a teleprompter offscreen. Not the worst movie out this holiday season and enjoyable as long as you refrain from high expectations."
"Anyone But You","pkertes-59666","5 January 2024",410,"I went to see this movie because I am a sucker for a romantic comedy, even the average ones (and let's face it, most of them are). Having seen the trailer, I had low expectations, yet this film still managed to come it at an even lower level.Boy meets girl, they hit it off briefly, there is a misunderstanding and when they reconnect through a friend/family wedding, they hate each other. Except as anyone could predict, ultimately they don't really, but it takes an eternity of inauthentic, puerile dross to get there. No tissues needed here.The acting is generally average to poor, and local actors like Rachel Griffiths and Bryan Brown (much of it filmed in Australia) do the minimum required, and are completely wasted here. The script is juvenile, facile and has little in common with reality. The direction is pedestrian and much of the movie is a travel ad for Sydney. Throw in plastic, unlikeable characters and a healthy dose of gratuitous nudity. The attempts at comedy are almost laughable as that, and what little romance eventuates at the end fails to convince after nearly two hours of tripe beforehand.Not recommended, even if you are a fan of the genre."
"Anyone But You","trinaboice","8 January 2024",410,"IN A NUTSHELL:
After an amazing first date, Bea and Ben's fiery attraction turns ice-cold until they find themselves unexpectedly reunited at a destination wedding in Australia that their exes also attend. So, they do what any two mature adults would do: pretend to be a couple amidst the fighting.The film was directed by Will Gluck, who also wrote it with Ilana Wolpert.Ultimately, this is like a rated R Hallmark movie with lots of raunch.THINGS I LIKED:
There is plenty of eye candy here for everyone. The cast is filled with good-looking people and includes Sydney Sweeney, Glen Powell, Alexandra Shipp, Hadley Robinson, GaTa, Michelle Hurd, Dermot Mulroney, Rachel Griffiths, Bryan Brown, and more.Sydney Sweeney was bit by a spider in the movie while filming. That famous clip was posted online and got a lot of stir.We get to visit Australia during the film.The cast is diverse, offering a variety of stories about romance and love.The last scene takes clips from the whole movie and has all of the actors sing the same song for a feel-good moment.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Sure, everyone in the cast is hot, but the script is garbage. It sounded like it was written by a trashy version of Chat GPT.It's supposed to be funny, but it's pathetic how they are instantly super ugly and mean-spirited to each other when they have a miscommunication.It's SUPER predictable.Cliched end-of-movie singing, dancing scene.So much fighting.So many awkward moments.They say the movie is loosely based on Shakepeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"", but I think the Bard would be disgusted by the lack of intelligent language in the script. So many F-bombs. One similarity is that they get a wedding cake from a shop called ""Dogberry's"", which is the name of a character in the play.I cringed and rolled my eyes so many times.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
This movie is definitely not appropriate for kids. It portrays unhealthy relationships and extremely bad behavior.Kids will be completely bored because it's mostly adults talking to each other.Profanity and lots of F-bombs
A lesbian couple kisses and gets married
We see a topless woman
We see several shirtless men
A couple gropes each other inside their shorts.Two women wear bikini tops that barely cover anything.We see a ton of cleavage
A lot of sexual innuendo. We see an unmarried couple in the shower and bed together.We see two men smoke a joint.!"
"Anyone But You","ambusched94","31 December 2023",210,"A forgettable, expendable rom-com where all the somewhat funny, shock value scenes are exposed in the theatrical trailer and there is hardly any laugh-out-loud scenes in this film overall.While Glen Powell has the comedy chops and romantic charm for this film genre, to my astonishment it's the EXACT OPPOSITE for Sydney Sweeney. Her line delivery is dull and she has the same facial expressions, blank stare, dead eyes for most scenes in Anyone But You. You can tell she's acting as in she's not embodying the character in the story and she's simply reading the lines, not conveying any natural nuances in her character each time she does this. Sweeney's crying scene in the taxi felt unnaturally forced. I was surprised her acting was half-a**ed, whereas in the TV series Euphoria (2019-present) her acting feels natural. Or highly likely that she's a limited-range, one-note actress that can only do dark, coming-of-age drama genre and fails at rom-com. IMO, Powell and Sweeney had the most chemistry when their characters were arguing and hating each other. When they got all lovey dovey, the on-screen chemistry felt forced and it was lacking that romantic spark between their characters. I was not invested enough in their progressing relationship to care once they officially got together in the end.So one, I feel like Sweeney largely ruins the film with her bland acting and line delivery, and lack of emotiveness. A better choice for the lead actress in this film should've been a comedic actress or an actress who can deftly juggle comedic timing and dramatic, emotional scenes. If this film was made and released in the 2000s decade for example, Amanda Bynes would be a prime choice for the role of Bea. And two, the character development is lacking and backstory are just tacked-on but don't add any characterization substance. The screenplay pushes the two characters to meet instantaneously at the start of the film, so viewers don't get any individual scenes of each lead character beforehand leaving a lot of character backstory nonexistent. The screenplay gives a brief overlay of each of Ben's and Bea's backstory in a scene montage and it's the error of telling over showing, and it doesn't work, leaving a rushed characterization of both characters that cheapens the film.Supporting characters feel like caricatures and don't add anything to the story. No supporting character was memorable. Some corny dialogue and meta rom-com instances that seem shoehorned in. Also, I wish Darren Barnet (Paxton from the TV series Never Have I Ever (2020-2023)) had more scenes, dialogue and that he would've been the guy Bea ended up with if there was an unexpected surprise, twist ending, instead of the ""enemies to lovers"" and ""stuck together so they'll end up together"" overused romance tropes. But the screenplay is too safe and screenwriters would never be bold enough to rise up to a different, atypical ending like this.I did like that the majority of the film was set in Australia and a few of the songs used in the film's soundtrack.It's ironic that Dermot Mulroney and Rachel Griffiths are in this sucky rom-com when blasting back to the past to 1997, both Mulroney (as the leading man and love interest) and Griffiths (in a supporting role) starred in a first rate quality rom-com, My Best Friend's Wedding. This is why most of my fave rom-coms are from the '90s and the 2000s. When quality storytelling, chemistry, and character development reigned in comparison to this current rom-com garbage.Anyone But You is a derivative, formulaic rom-com that's ultimately unmemorable, vapid rom-com plot, and a waste of time. Just casually watch it once it comes out on streaming if you have nothing else to watch and don't care about draining 1 hour 43 minutes of your time."
"Anyone But You","dogonlion","10 February 2024",110,"Everything in this movie feels forced. The comedy is like ""please laugh, please laugh"". I guess that works on some. Nothing flows naturally. The way they love at first sight and all of the sudden start bickering is unrealistic. The bickering is annoying. Sydney Sweeney is a really good actress, I really liked her in The White Lotus, but she's hasn't been in a movie that uses her full potential yet. The movie is full of cliches. It even has the funny black friend with no love life. I'm really shocked by how much money this movie made. I guess as long as those kinds of movies make money they'll keep the same formula and keep factory produce them and soon will use artificial intelligence to write them."

It had some cute scenes. I gotta say the ensemble was pretty good if I laughed it was always because something one of them said. They were a bunch of goofy characters. I also enjoyed dermot mulroney's character when he was learning how to dive and the reoccurance of that at the end of the movie. It made me giggle.But I gotta say... the dialogue was very mediocre and at times just not good at all. It just lacked depth which again didn't expect it to have depth but still could have been better."

Overall, an incredibly formulaic Rom-Com that tries way too hard to capitalize on the popularity and looks of Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney, but fails hard as it is so predictable and barely funny.Bad Direction (The whole movie just feels like the studio shelled out something to tick boxes rather than make a well thought-out comedy (this included plot concepts, wardrobing, and jokes) because that's what they think the audience 'wants' as they try too hard to be 'modern,' meaning the director couldn't make any creative decisions; the direction on both a macro and microscale feels very formulaic to other Rom-Coms; the direction of actors is very bad as he does not establish any chemistry for the cast as all the performances feel mundane and toneless; the storytelling is a formulaic and predictable Rom-Com), Bad Acting (Bad to Pretty Bad from Sydney Sweeney (The overall performance feels mundane and toneless and she fails to establish any chemistry with Glen Powell, but she does have some moments where she does a decent to pretty good job), Decent to Pretty Good from Glen Powell (The only positive performance in the movie as he holds his own and leads the movie well as a Rom-Com lead (it's just the material is so bad he can only do so much)), Decent from Alexandra Shipp (Actually holds her own well and shows some a little range (which is a lot given this movie)), Bad from GaTa (Cannot match the levels of any of the other actors and feels very toneless with little effort), Pretty Bad from Hadley Robinson (Just doesn't offer anything), Decent from Michelle Hurd (Shows some experience and decent timing), Decent from Dermot Mulroney (Has some charisma and timing), Decent from Charlee Fraser (The most surprising performance of the movie as she holds her own fairly well and establishes some charm and chemistry with Glen Powell), Very Bad from the rest of the cast (Just a lot of toneless and stereotypical Rom-Com performances; there is no chemistry in the entire cast)), Very Bad Story (The concept is a modern retelling of Shakespeare's 'Much Ado About Nothing,' but it does not do anything to be unique as it just follows the cookie cutter Rom-Com plot (mixed with forced modern references); the story construction is incredibly formulaic as each scene is incredibly predictable on what is going to happen and where it is going to go; because the movie is so predictable, there is a flow because it just follows this boilerplate to a tea; the character writing is terrible as all the characters as so shallow and stereotypical to Rom-Coms (and things are brought up for characters that never get addressed or add more depth to the characters)), Very Bad Screenplay (The dialogue is atrocious and very predictable (the movie forces in so many modern references that it just feels like they are pandering to the youth rather than writing realistic dialogue); the joke hit rate is probably 1 out of every 5 jokes (and some of the jokes are just so stupid that its cringe at how they even made this movie); the symbolism is incredibly overt (with the quotes from the source material and the messages of the story being overlaid onto the screen); the foreshadowing is incredibly overt that it makes the movie incredibly predictable), Decent Score; Decent Soundtrack (Did enjoy the songs they chose), Pretty Good Cinematography (Very polished as you could tell the studio put in a lot of money to make this movie), Pretty Bad Sound (Some of the sound effects are just off from what happened), Decent Editing (The actual edit was very polished and felt like it had a big budget; the cut for the movie just feels weird as it is obvious where they did reshoots and what was originally shot), Good Costumes (They made a very conscious decision with what each character was wearing to get people to watch this movie (and I respect that)), Plot Structure followed the source material's and Rom-Com template to a tee (which made the movie incredibly formulaic and predictable), Pacing was decent (as it kept the Rom-Com pace), Climax was so forced and incredibly formulaic (which made me cringe very hard when watching this movie), Tone was very similar to other Rom-Coms (especially from the early 2010s), It was so obvious where there were reshoots for this movie as some of the scenes were so bad and some were more tolerable."
"Anyone But You","masonsaul","30 December 2023",710,"Anyone But You is an enjoyably cynical rom com that still has plenty of heartfelt romance at its centre. Just getting one of these theatrically released currently is kind of a miracle and it plays squarely to the genre's strengths. All its beats are predictable in the best way.Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell are on their way to becoming genuine movie stars and this film only further solidifies that. The constant barbs they send each other's way for the majority of the film are really funny and the chemistry they're constantly trying to deny has a real spark to it.This isn't Will Gluck's first rom com and that's apparent in the good ways. The broad physical comedy is balanced nicely by the snappy wit interspersed throughout and it's surprisingly epic (a lot more helicopter stuff than expected). A good soundtrack always helps with this genre and the one here nails it."
"Anyone But You","Remmuchan","27 December 2023",310,"I cannot for the life of me understand how this ended up being a movie shown in theaters. I went into this having no idea what the movie was about. I can now say that I wish I never even bothered to purchase a ticket to see this atrocity. It was the biggest waste of my time ever.I cannot tell you how many times I cringed watching this and how many times I wanted it to just end. The acting was AWFUL, especially from the lead actress who tried so hard to act seductive but it just came off as terrible. Everything about this movie made no sense. The plot line was awful. It felt like watching a really cheesy Netflix rom-com but a hundred times worse. The shocking nude scenes just added to its awfulness.I can't get over how bad this is and I really think they just wanted to make something to tick all the boxes of what a rom-com is except it did not tick any of those boxes at all. Terrible acting, terrible movie, terrible plot line, terrible directing, terrible EVERYTHING.I HATED this movie. Avoid at all costs."
"Anyone But You","MichaelByTheSea","26 December 2023",910,"This was like an R rated raunchy Hallmark movie where people actually have sex. I can do without the miscommunication trope that drove apart a couple that seemed to be connecting, but I enjoyed the banter and really enjoyed the stars.""Serious"" critics typically don't appreciate the rom-com genre and judge them harshly. I went with my adult children and we all loved the movie. My kids make fun of my love for Hallmark movies, but even they liked this one. We laughed out loud repeatedly and walked out smiling. I love that feeling.Sure, the script is flawed, the plot's ridiculous, and some of the dialogue is a bit off, but Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney light up the screen with their amazing chemistry. They're extraordinary specimens and look like they spend 6 hours a day in the gym, but I also like them as actors. Glen Powell was really good in another enjoyable modern rom-com with Zoey Deutch called ""Set It Up"" and he's fearless here, especially with the over the top body humor.Sydney Sweeney is certainly voluptuous, and gorgeous to look at, but she's also established herself as a great actress in more critic friendly shows like ""Euphoria"" and ""White Lotus"". Edgy and dark is fine, and it certainly gets taken more seriously by the critics, but I prefer getting lost in an escapist rom-com that doesn't involve terrible people doing terrible things.I want more of this."

"Anyone But You","NatKaminska","28 December 2023",110,"I need to warn those of you who want to spend your money on this thing: don't do it, not worth it. I watched the movie and it was horrible. It tried to be a charming '90s and '2000s rom-com, yet it failed in every department except with the male lead. Glen Powell is the only good thing about this movie.'Anyone but you' is full of cliches and while you can do cliches in a good way, and make genuine, great gem of a specific genre, this is not the case here. The movie is boring, shallow, cringe comedy with typical cringe, over-the-top, not-funny jokes, maybe 1 joke lands in the entire movie, that's how bad it is. The supposedly 'hilarious' nude scene on the cliff, especially the part when Powell is bending over, completely naked, holding his balls in his hands, is the next level of cringe, nothing funny, nothing charming, just cringe, awkward, awful. It's also full of heavy, not subtle, and obvious cultural references as if the writers just wrote down popular internet memes. Man, these writers really don't have any respect for the viewers. I basically wanted to walk out of this movie after the first 15 minutes.The romance part is badly done as well. The chemistry is average at best, just like a normal chemistry between two beautiful people - they are easy on the eyes oh right, like most people in this industry, but nothing more. They are not Mulder and Scully or Hanks and Ryan. Another problem with the main couple is that only Powell is to some degree likable, even tho the script doesn't make his character particularly likable, Powell's natural charisma and charm do the trick. With Sweeney that doesn't exist, she is utterly unlikeable as Bea, and this flaw kills the romance and fun completely. Despite what was said about this duo during the last summer and what some of their blind stans and the media still say now, they don't fit together as a rom-com couple at all!The screenplay itself doesn't help the actors achieve any chemistry, as the entire story is incredibly predictable, and thus boring, with awful dialogues and wooden acting most of the time.Nothing really happens in this movie! Any romantic comedy has to have some stakes in the relationship, some solid drama, and funny, unexpected twists and turns that make sense at least in the fictional universe. In this movie, the conflict that starts Ben and Bea's feud doesn't even make sense! Literally, one minute of simple explanation would clear the air between them, as they are visibly attracted to each other, from the first moment they meet. So the whole basis of this film, that they hate each other, doesn't make sense. We needed some stronger reason for the hate here.Yes, I'm aware that this movie is based on Shakespeare's play 'Much Ado About Nothing', and that one point of that play is that a great fuss/drama between the protagonists started from something insignificant ('nothing'), but every artist, and not only an artist but average person, knows that film is a completely different medium than a theater play, and what worked in a play about romance, written in Shakespeare's times, doesn't work as well in a modern, romantic comedy film. This movie isn't written intelligently enough to make it work either. Again, for the plot to be compelling in this film, we needed a stronger reason for hatred between the main characters, and the development of the characters, and we got neither of those things. Throughout the film, the characters are basic sketches, and we don't know much about them till the end.Then, during the next two, remaining acts of the movie, also nothing really happens. They decide to fake that they are together out of the blue, and their reasons for it are also simply not good enough for the audience to care about the characters and the story. Throughout the entire film, we don't see at all that Ben genuinely desires his ex, and Bea's parents don't have enough of the presence, are completely flat, insignificant characters for the audience to believe or care that she needs to lie to them, which were the two main reasons for the masquerade. Therefore, another giant flaw of the script: the motivations of the main characters that are supposed to push the plot forward are insufficient to be credible and interesting to the audience.In general, the problem is that nothing is fleshed out in 'Anyone but You' - not the main storyline, not the two main leads, not the background characters, drama, or comedy.The 'meta' lines in the script, the kinda 'wink- wink we know it's typical rom-com trope' also don't work because for this to work, the entire script would have to be much more intelligent and satirical, and it isn't smart or a satire at all! It just tried to cheat the audience by doing this, or the writers gave themselves an easy excuse for the rest of their bad writing, and again - it doesn't work. Nothing works in this movie.Yet another big problem: Sydney doesn't have a talent for comedy, sorry. Her delivery is very bland and too stiff, her character is flat, like cut out of a cardboard figure. I just don't understand how someone like her could get the role specifically in romantic comedy if she doesn't fit this role at all. Weren't there some other, better, and actually comedy-talented, cute actresses available during the casting process? Or was it just an easy money grab because it is Sydney Sweeney from 'Euphoria'?Glen is the only one who can be genuinely hilarious and gives his all, and that is not a surprise for anyone who follows his career. Glen already showed his comedy talent in Scream Queens but also proved it as Hangman in Top Gun. He is a very funny guy in real life too, as you can see in his interviews, so it's obvious comedy is natural for him. That's why he absolutely is in his element in this movie, and he 'feels it' but the problem is no one of the rest of the cast is, including Sydney. And Glen alone is still not good enough to save this movie.When you have such a difference in comedic chops between two leads in a romantic comedy that is a giant problem. I don't know if you noticed, but the hilarious thing is, you can already see in the trailers, that Sydney is not good at all in this movie. I remember that I commented her delivery is terrible the minute I watched the trailer!After I watched this movie, I definitely think Glen is much better in romantic comedies when paired with Zoey Deutch. Glen has a way better, more organic, and natural chemistry with Zoey than with Sydney, maybe because Zoey has a comedy talent just like Glen. I saw on Glen's IMDB that he is going to star in another comedy with Zoey, hopefully, better written than this one, so I will wait for it.To sum up, 'Anyone but You' is not worth one second of your time, your money, or any buzz, just wait for the the movie to appear on the streaming platforms. It doesn't have the great main couple, it doesn't have good background characters, it doesn't have the charm, wit, and natural flow that romantic comedies of the '90s or early '2000 had, like She's All That, Love Actually, Holiday, 10 Things I Hate About You, or How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.It simply doesn't have good or even decent writing! And I'm not the enemy of romantic comedies, I'm a woman and aspiring filmmaker, I love great romantic comedies just like any other great movie, of any other genre. But this movie is so bad, that I genuinely felt ashamed while watching it - I felt ashamed for the filmmakers who made this, especially the writers. Don't bother!"
"Anyone But You","SnoopyStyle","24 February 2024",610,"Bea (Sydney Sweeney) meets Ben (Glen Powell) in a coffee shop and they hook up. There are misunderstandings next morning and they leave angry. It turns out that his friend is marrying her sister. The two enemies have to attend a destination wedding in Australia.Sweeney and Powell are trying all kind of broad physical humor. They are both gorgeous and both have good charisma. Neither are outright comedians and that is important. They are mildly funny but are rarely the funniest part. The first big laugh is the WTF old guy while the two bicker. The butt grabbing scene kinda works, but the leads may be overshadowed by a koala. This duo tries very hard. It's so ridiculous that it's mildly funny."
"Anyone But You","johnnymonsarrat","3 February 2024",410,"Hello again, fellow film travelers.I have to wonder what happened to the writing of this movie. There are some interesting and touching twists to the plot. But mainly it seems plot driven, not character driven. Characters don't make consistent choices with their personality or logic, for example what happens with the parents at the end.The male lead has an acting style that's full of confidence, but he's supposed to be a comic figure that has disabling phobias. God knows why he can barely swim but he can teach diving.The female lead, I take no pleasure in saying this, tends to speak at the other actors instead of to them.I get that the writers were trying to go for a Shakespeare type of thing, like Much Ado About Nothing, but the movie simply wasn't comedic enough to have unconvincing character choices. You can get away with a lot of goofy stuff in a slapstick comedy. But this had mostly drama. So the characters need to make sense.I am sorry. I really wanted to like this.There were hints of genius. There was some good physical comedy and a few touchimg moments. But the cringe worthy flaws buried them."

We left around the halfway mark because I kept hoping that it would improve - a waste of time & our weekly movie budget. The actors were given dialog that was juvenile and scene set-ups that were embarrassing. Lots of gratitious nudity and shots of partial nudity. Anyone interested in seeing this movie should just watch the trailer - it gives viewers a good picture of what they'll see at the theater so they don't waste their time sitting through a really bad movie. It was great seeing Bryan Brown but I wish he had chosen a better vehicle in which to appear than this dreck. I had greater expections for Glen Powell, but then maybe this is the level of his actual talent. Sad."
"Anyone But You","DeanAmythe","4 January 2024",410,"Never been into romcoms all that much (I watch movies alone all day as a true cinglephile), though I acknowledge their importance in filling the void for comfort watches: predictable, feel-good, and just the right amount of schmaltz - perfect for a night out (or in). Their template structure isn't so much a concern rather than an obstacle to overcome, which can be achieved with a fun gimmick of some sort, or, simply, by hitting the comedic marks. If this genre wants to see its resurgence these points are vital, and last year's NO HARD FEELINGS was eager to prove that, a return to form yet still raunchy and imbued with a surprising air of maturity - and even when the jokes didn't land, there was still enjoyment to be found in the excellent(ly cast) leads. ANYONE BUT YOU is as back-to-basics as it could get and appears to be, to a certain extent, aware of that, though here the drive to still be its own thing is completely absent. What immediately stands out is the central 'do-they, don't-they', which pretty much feeds directly into the classic plot structure and is barely taken advantage of. When it is being used for comedic purposes, it easily produces the highlights of the film, like the view/spider scene. Most of this, though, is by-the-numbers and safe, lacking any edge or remarkable features aside from the leads' sex appeal (on that front, the quality of the casting is equal to NO HARD FEELINGS). Speaking of them, Powell is as fun as expected - he would most likely be a solid movie star if the current Hollywood system allowed for those - but Sweeney? No clue what she's doing with those line reads, constantly sounding like a bad impression of an American high school girl with a ready disinterest in everything. Not that she has that much to work with anyway, as the script suffers from eye-rollers of jokes, that first half especially bursting with ""did I just say that out loud?"" humor. My sold out screening was awfully silent through most of this, though maybe they were just there for the aforementioned hotties. Just so you know: you don't get a (proper) view of Sweeney's melons, but you do get to see a squeezed Australian glans. 4/10."

"Anyone But You","ethanbresnett","6 January 2024",710,"Anyone But You caught me a little bit by surprise I must say. Perhaps that's because my expectations were quite low, but they really needn't have been as this film is a really solid romcom.Primarily this comes from Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney. A romcom lives and dies by its romantic leads, and they are both great in this, nailing the weird and evolving chemistry between their two characters. They are each decently well written, feeling believable and engaging.On top of this, there is a fairly forgettable but perfectly pleasant assortment of supporting characters who add some extra levels of humour to the piece.Speaking of humour, it is a bit hit and miss in this film. There aren't many big laughs, but it is amusing and does have a light and goofy tone throughout that is befitting of any romcom.Now, this film doesn't really reinvent the wheel in any way. It has all the same story beats as most romcoms and doesn't take too many risks. Therefore the plot is fairly mediocre and (as with practically all romcoms) is far too predictable. This never really gets in the way of the fun though, but the inevitable ending does make it feel a teensy bit too long.Overall though I think this is a really solid film. It has a good tone, a couple of engaging leads, and will give you a few laughs too."
"Anyone But You","tm-sheehan","5 January 2024",610,"My Review. Anyone But You
My Rating. 6:10Very very loosely based on Shakespeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"" with even a few quotations in the background and title cards this pleasant enough rom com reminds me of a line from a 16 th Century play The Merchant of Venice by same William Shakespeare, ""All that glisters is not gold"".Which of course translates in today's language ""All that glitters is not gold "".Anyone But You has a pleasant cast set in and around Sydney which is fun to spot locations like the QVB building, and our beautiful harbour vistas and pristine beaches.I was reminded of a far superior Classic romantic comedy ""My Best Friend's Wedding "" 1997 when I saw the actor playing the brides father Dermot Mulroney who achieved great success playing a similar lead 26 years ago to Glen Powell who plays Ben the romantic lead man in this movie.I enjoyed both the young leads Sydney Sweeney who plays Bea and Glen Powell who play the star crossed lovers .The differences and similarities for me in great romance comedies with weddings like My Best Friends Wedding and more recently Crazy Rich Asians is obvious they all look fabulous with surroundings that celebrate the affluence of wealthy privileged people .Where they differ from each other is in the quality of the script writing in this case by Ilana Wolpert and Will Gluck.Light comedy can be clever if it's not pretentious why try and improve on Shakespeare? It's an impossible task.Anyone But You is entertaining but parts of it I found really irritating and contrived.Adding a same sex wedding was a nice modern touch but it's the most heterosexual same sex wedding I've ever seen not one Gay in this village except Claudia and Halle the betrothed couple.The most irritating characters for me were the parents of the brides played by Dermot Mulroney, Rachel Griffiths, Bryan Brown and Michelle Hurd they all seemed to be trying to hard .I can't be to critical of this light comedy that probably appeals to a younger audience demographic than myself .I hope it succeeds overseas as we need to export more home grown cinema product from Australia but we can't just rely on great scenery and cute animal platitudes like winking koalas ."

Weak story, unnecessarily extensive vulgar language, and excessive nudity humiliates the actors. Embarrassing movie that degrades men and women and shows no imagination.

"Anyone But You","movieman6-413-929510","5 January 2024",510,"Anyone But You is a new romantic comedy directed, written and produced in part by Will Gluck, director of Easy A and Friends with Benefits.Bea (Sydney Sweeney) and Ben (Glen Powell) haven't seen each other since a first date. When they are both invited to the same wedding, the two meet again.They learn that people are trying to hook them up so they don't cause further problems during the wedding. This is why they pretend, to get rid of the fuss.Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell have good chemistry together in the film and both know how to play well and playfully with and against each other. Despite their chemistry, the overall film is unfortunately more on the standard side of a romantic comedy. This gives the film game its well-known and predictable sides. Other moments come across as a bit too forced. For co-writer Ilana Wolpert, this is only her first written film story.Another downside of the film is the amount of extra characters. Many of these extras bring their own kind of comedy, but otherwise have little real use in the film.

Maybe will distract people from her weird acting and that strange way of talking like she has something lodged on her cheeks.Dont waste your money or time in this , go do laundry or try to make that recipe you saved from tik tok.There is a reason they were trying so hard with the promo, EVERYBODY KNEW IT WAS A FLOP."
"Anyone But You","alyetc","28 December 2023",510,"We've seen a million movies set at weddings before - where even the couple getting married gets invested in the main couples status. So I knew a lot of the tropes would be the same, but it was the same but a bit worse. The main couple story I actually really liked, I thought they were hilarious and cute and beat out other movies with the same storyline. It was everything else that fell short. The background characters felt cheesy and fake. All surface level gags or you didn't really get to know them, nothing felt genuine - case in point Bea's parents were incredibly unrealistic, no ones that out of touch. Even Bea's background felt half-done, never explaining why she didn't want law school."
"Anyone But You","STARONTHETOPOFTHESKY","11 February 2024",110,"The movie, unfortunately, failed to deliver on multiple fronts. Its repetitive and cliché romantic comedy storyline lacked originality, leaving the audience unengaged. The attempts at humor fell flat, resulting in a tedious and cringe-worthy viewing experience. To add to the disappointment, the lead actress's annoying voice only added to the overall lackluster quality of the film, making it a forgettable and uninspiring cinematic endeavor. Terrible acting and story. I don't understand the high rating of this movie, or the hype. Save your time and skip this one. The movie is downright horrible, with uncomfortable scenes that make you question their choices. Shame on them for delivering such a poorly written script, leading to an overall disappointing and regrettable cinematic experience."
"Anyone But You","barbett-1","1 January 2024",510,"Neither brilliant nor dreadful, ""Anyone But You"" features a cast of characters that are unbelievably attractive and, apparently, insanely wealthy. It stars Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeny's breasts in the formulatic equivalent of a Hallmark Movie knock-off. You know the drill - two perfect young people meet, are instantly attracted to each other, are separated by a misunderstanding with hilarious hijinks ensuing. The misunderstanding is eventually resolved, love blooms once more, and all ends well.What sets this film apart is excellent cinematography with lovely wide-angle views of the Australian countryside. The supporting cast is very capable although the Australian men are played as oafish stereotypes. Glen Powell plays his part well, but Sydney Sweeny appears to be reading her lines from a teleprompter offscreen. Not the worst movie out this holiday season and enjoyable as long as you refrain from high expectations."
"Anyone But You","pkertes-59666","5 January 2024",410,"I went to see this movie because I am a sucker for a romantic comedy, even the average ones (and let's face it, most of them are). Having seen the trailer, I had low expectations, yet this film still managed to come it at an even lower level.Boy meets girl, they hit it off briefly, there is a misunderstanding and when they reconnect through a friend/family wedding, they hate each other. Except as anyone could predict, ultimately they don't really, but it takes an eternity of inauthentic, puerile dross to get there. No tissues needed here.The acting is generally average to poor, and local actors like Rachel Griffiths and Bryan Brown (much of it filmed in Australia) do the minimum required, and are completely wasted here. The script is juvenile, facile and has little in common with reality. The direction is pedestrian and much of the movie is a travel ad for Sydney. Throw in plastic, unlikeable characters and a healthy dose of gratuitous nudity. The attempts at comedy are almost laughable as that, and what little romance eventuates at the end fails to convince after nearly two hours of tripe beforehand.Not recommended, even if you are a fan of the genre."
"Anyone But You","trinaboice","8 January 2024",410,"IN A NUTSHELL:
After an amazing first date, Bea and Ben's fiery attraction turns ice-cold until they find themselves unexpectedly reunited at a destination wedding in Australia that their exes also attend. So, they do what any two mature adults would do: pretend to be a couple amidst the fighting.The film was directed by Will Gluck, who also wrote it with Ilana Wolpert.Ultimately, this is like a rated R Hallmark movie with lots of raunch.THINGS I LIKED:
There is plenty of eye candy here for everyone. The cast is filled with good-looking people and includes Sydney Sweeney, Glen Powell, Alexandra Shipp, Hadley Robinson, GaTa, Michelle Hurd, Dermot Mulroney, Rachel Griffiths, Bryan Brown, and more.Sydney Sweeney was bit by a spider in the movie while filming. That famous clip was posted online and got a lot of stir.We get to visit Australia during the film.The cast is diverse, offering a variety of stories about romance and love.The last scene takes clips from the whole movie and has all of the actors sing the same song for a feel-good moment.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Sure, everyone in the cast is hot, but the script is garbage. It sounded like it was written by a trashy version of Chat GPT.It's supposed to be funny, but it's pathetic how they are instantly super ugly and mean-spirited to each other when they have a miscommunication.It's SUPER predictable.Cliched end-of-movie singing, dancing scene.So much fighting.So many awkward moments.They say the movie is loosely based on Shakepeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"", but I think the Bard would be disgusted by the lack of intelligent language in the script. So many F-bombs. One similarity is that they get a wedding cake from a shop called ""Dogberry's"", which is the name of a character in the play.I cringed and rolled my eyes so many times.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
This movie is definitely not appropriate for kids. It portrays unhealthy relationships and extremely bad behavior.Kids will be completely bored because it's mostly adults talking to each other.Profanity and lots of F-bombs
A lesbian couple kisses and gets married
We see a topless woman
We see several shirtless men
A couple gropes each other inside their shorts.Two women wear bikini tops that barely cover anything.We see a ton of cleavage
A lot of sexual innuendo. We see an unmarried couple in the shower and bed together.We see two men smoke a joint.!"
"Anyone But You","ambusched94","31 December 2023",210,"A forgettable, expendable rom-com where all the somewhat funny, shock value scenes are exposed in the theatrical trailer and there is hardly any laugh-out-loud scenes in this film overall.While Glen Powell has the comedy chops and romantic charm for this film genre, to my astonishment it's the EXACT OPPOSITE for Sydney Sweeney. Her line delivery is dull and she has the same facial expressions, blank stare, dead eyes for most scenes in Anyone But You. You can tell she's acting as in she's not embodying the character in the story and she's simply reading the lines, not conveying any natural nuances in her character each time she does this. Sweeney's crying scene in the taxi felt unnaturally forced. I was surprised her acting was half-a**ed, whereas in the TV series Euphoria (2019-present) her acting feels natural. Or highly likely that she's a limited-range, one-note actress that can only do dark, coming-of-age drama genre and fails at rom-com. IMO, Powell and Sweeney had the most chemistry when their characters were arguing and hating each other. When they got all lovey dovey, the on-screen chemistry felt forced and it was lacking that romantic spark between their characters. I was not invested enough in their progressing relationship to care once they officially got together in the end.So one, I feel like Sweeney largely ruins the film with her bland acting and line delivery, and lack of emotiveness. A better choice for the lead actress in this film should've been a comedic actress or an actress who can deftly juggle comedic timing and dramatic, emotional scenes. If this film was made and released in the 2000s decade for example, Amanda Bynes would be a prime choice for the role of Bea. And two, the character development is lacking and backstory are just tacked-on but don't add any characterization substance. The screenplay pushes the two characters to meet instantaneously at the start of the film, so viewers don't get any individual scenes of each lead character beforehand leaving a lot of character backstory nonexistent. The screenplay gives a brief overlay of each of Ben's and Bea's backstory in a scene montage and it's the error of telling over showing, and it doesn't work, leaving a rushed characterization of both characters that cheapens the film.Supporting characters feel like caricatures and don't add anything to the story. No supporting character was memorable. Some corny dialogue and meta rom-com instances that seem shoehorned in. Also, I wish Darren Barnet (Paxton from the TV series Never Have I Ever (2020-2023)) had more scenes, dialogue and that he would've been the guy Bea ended up with if there was an unexpected surprise, twist ending, instead of the ""enemies to lovers"" and ""stuck together so they'll end up together"" overused romance tropes. But the screenplay is too safe and screenwriters would never be bold enough to rise up to a different, atypical ending like this.I did like that the majority of the film was set in Australia and a few of the songs used in the film's soundtrack.It's ironic that Dermot Mulroney and Rachel Griffiths are in this sucky rom-com when blasting back to the past to 1997, both Mulroney (as the leading man and love interest) and Griffiths (in a supporting role) starred in a first rate quality rom-com, My Best Friend's Wedding. This is why most of my fave rom-coms are from the '90s and the 2000s. When quality storytelling, chemistry, and character development reigned in comparison to this current rom-com garbage.Anyone But You is a derivative, formulaic rom-com that's ultimately unmemorable, vapid rom-com plot, and a waste of time. Just casually watch it once it comes out on streaming if you have nothing else to watch and don't care about draining 1 hour 43 minutes of your time."
"Anyone But You","dogonlion","10 February 2024",110,"Everything in this movie feels forced. The comedy is like ""please laugh, please laugh"". I guess that works on some. Nothing flows naturally. The way they love at first sight and all of the sudden start bickering is unrealistic. The bickering is annoying. Sydney Sweeney is a really good actress, I really liked her in The White Lotus, but she's hasn't been in a movie that uses her full potential yet. The movie is full of cliches. It even has the funny black friend with no love life. I'm really shocked by how much money this movie made. I guess as long as those kinds of movies make money they'll keep the same formula and keep factory produce them and soon will use artificial intelligence to write them."

It had some cute scenes. I gotta say the ensemble was pretty good if I laughed it was always because something one of them said. They were a bunch of goofy characters. I also enjoyed dermot mulroney's character when he was learning how to dive and the reoccurance of that at the end of the movie. It made me giggle.But I gotta say... the dialogue was very mediocre and at times just not good at all. It just lacked depth which again didn't expect it to have depth but still could have been better."

Overall, an incredibly formulaic Rom-Com that tries way too hard to capitalize on the popularity and looks of Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney, but fails hard as it is so predictable and barely funny.Bad Direction (The whole movie just feels like the studio shelled out something to tick boxes rather than make a well thought-out comedy (this included plot concepts, wardrobing, and jokes) because that's what they think the audience 'wants' as they try too hard to be 'modern,' meaning the director couldn't make any creative decisions; the direction on both a macro and microscale feels very formulaic to other Rom-Coms; the direction of actors is very bad as he does not establish any chemistry for the cast as all the performances feel mundane and toneless; the storytelling is a formulaic and predictable Rom-Com), Bad Acting (Bad to Pretty Bad from Sydney Sweeney (The overall performance feels mundane and toneless and she fails to establish any chemistry with Glen Powell, but she does have some moments where she does a decent to pretty good job), Decent to Pretty Good from Glen Powell (The only positive performance in the movie as he holds his own and leads the movie well as a Rom-Com lead (it's just the material is so bad he can only do so much)), Decent from Alexandra Shipp (Actually holds her own well and shows some a little range (which is a lot given this movie)), Bad from GaTa (Cannot match the levels of any of the other actors and feels very toneless with little effort), Pretty Bad from Hadley Robinson (Just doesn't offer anything), Decent from Michelle Hurd (Shows some experience and decent timing), Decent from Dermot Mulroney (Has some charisma and timing), Decent from Charlee Fraser (The most surprising performance of the movie as she holds her own fairly well and establishes some charm and chemistry with Glen Powell), Very Bad from the rest of the cast (Just a lot of toneless and stereotypical Rom-Com performances; there is no chemistry in the entire cast)), Very Bad Story (The concept is a modern retelling of Shakespeare's 'Much Ado About Nothing,' but it does not do anything to be unique as it just follows the cookie cutter Rom-Com plot (mixed with forced modern references); the story construction is incredibly formulaic as each scene is incredibly predictable on what is going to happen and where it is going to go; because the movie is so predictable, there is a flow because it just follows this boilerplate to a tea; the character writing is terrible as all the characters as so shallow and stereotypical to Rom-Coms (and things are brought up for characters that never get addressed or add more depth to the characters)), Very Bad Screenplay (The dialogue is atrocious and very predictable (the movie forces in so many modern references that it just feels like they are pandering to the youth rather than writing realistic dialogue); the joke hit rate is probably 1 out of every 5 jokes (and some of the jokes are just so stupid that its cringe at how they even made this movie); the symbolism is incredibly overt (with the quotes from the source material and the messages of the story being overlaid onto the screen); the foreshadowing is incredibly overt that it makes the movie incredibly predictable), Decent Score; Decent Soundtrack (Did enjoy the songs they chose), Pretty Good Cinematography (Very polished as you could tell the studio put in a lot of money to make this movie), Pretty Bad Sound (Some of the sound effects are just off from what happened), Decent Editing (The actual edit was very polished and felt like it had a big budget; the cut for the movie just feels weird as it is obvious where they did reshoots and what was originally shot), Good Costumes (They made a very conscious decision with what each character was wearing to get people to watch this movie (and I respect that)), Plot Structure followed the source material's and Rom-Com template to a tee (which made the movie incredibly formulaic and predictable), Pacing was decent (as it kept the Rom-Com pace), Climax was so forced and incredibly formulaic (which made me cringe very hard when watching this movie), Tone was very similar to other Rom-Coms (especially from the early 2010s), It was so obvious where there were reshoots for this movie as some of the scenes were so bad and some were more tolerable."
"Anyone But You","masonsaul","30 December 2023",710,"Anyone But You is an enjoyably cynical rom com that still has plenty of heartfelt romance at its centre. Just getting one of these theatrically released currently is kind of a miracle and it plays squarely to the genre's strengths. All its beats are predictable in the best way.Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell are on their way to becoming genuine movie stars and this film only further solidifies that. The constant barbs they send each other's way for the majority of the film are really funny and the chemistry they're constantly trying to deny has a real spark to it.This isn't Will Gluck's first rom com and that's apparent in the good ways. The broad physical comedy is balanced nicely by the snappy wit interspersed throughout and it's surprisingly epic (a lot more helicopter stuff than expected). A good soundtrack always helps with this genre and the one here nails it."
"Anyone But You","Remmuchan","27 December 2023",310,"I cannot for the life of me understand how this ended up being a movie shown in theaters.

It was the biggest waste of my time ever.I cannot tell you how many times I cringed watching this and how many times I wanted it to just end. The acting was AWFUL, especially from the lead actress who tried so hard to act seductive but it just came off as terrible. Everything about this movie made no sense. The plot line was awful. It felt like watching a really cheesy Netflix rom-com but a hundred times worse. The shocking nude scenes just added to its awfulness.I can't get over how bad this is and I really think they just wanted to make something to tick all the boxes of what a rom-com is except it did not tick any of those boxes at all.

"Anyone But You","MichaelByTheSea","26 December 2023",910,"This was like an R rated raunchy Hallmark movie where people actually have sex. I can do without the miscommunication trope that drove apart a couple that seemed to be connecting, but I enjoyed the banter and really enjoyed the stars.""Serious"" critics typically don't appreciate the rom-com genre and judge them harshly. I went with my adult children and we all loved the movie. My kids make fun of my love for Hallmark movies, but even they liked this one. We laughed out loud repeatedly and walked out smiling. I love that feeling.Sure, the script is flawed, the plot's ridiculous, and some of the dialogue is a bit off, but Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney light up the screen with their amazing chemistry. They're extraordinary specimens and look like they spend 6 hours a day in the gym, but I also like them as actors. Glen Powell was really good in another enjoyable modern rom-com with Zoey Deutch called ""Set It Up"" and he's fearless here, especially with the over the top body humor.Sydney Sweeney is certainly voluptuous, and gorgeous to look at, but she's also established herself as a great actress in more critic friendly shows like ""Euphoria"" and ""White Lotus"". Edgy and dark is fine, and it certainly gets taken more seriously by the critics, but I prefer getting lost in an escapist rom-com that doesn't involve terrible people doing terrible things.I want more of this."

"Anyone But You","NatKaminska","28 December 2023",110,"I need to warn those of you who want to spend your money on this thing: don't do it, not worth it. I watched the movie and it was horrible. It tried to be a charming '90s and '2000s rom-com, yet it failed in every department except with the male lead. Glen Powell is the only good thing about this movie.'Anyone but you' is full of cliches and while you can do cliches in a good way, and make genuine, great gem of a specific genre, this is not the case here. The movie is boring, shallow, cringe comedy with typical cringe, over-the-top, not-funny jokes, maybe 1 joke lands in the entire movie, that's how bad it is. The supposedly 'hilarious' nude scene on the cliff, especially the part when Powell is bending over, completely naked, holding his balls in his hands, is the next level of cringe, nothing funny, nothing charming, just cringe, awkward, awful. It's also full of heavy, not subtle, and obvious cultural references as if the writers just wrote down popular internet memes. Man, these writers really don't have any respect for the viewers. I basically wanted to walk out of this movie after the first 15 minutes.The romance part is badly done as well. The chemistry is average at best, just like a normal chemistry between two beautiful people - they are easy on the eyes oh right, like most people in this industry, but nothing more. They are not Mulder and Scully or Hanks and Ryan. Another problem with the main couple is that only Powell is to some degree likable, even tho the script doesn't make his character particularly likable, Powell's natural charisma and charm do the trick. With Sweeney that doesn't exist, she is utterly unlikeable as Bea, and this flaw kills the romance and fun completely. Despite what was said about this duo during the last summer and what some of their blind stans and the media still say now, they don't fit together as a rom-com couple at all!The screenplay itself doesn't help the actors achieve any chemistry, as the entire story is incredibly predictable, and thus boring, with awful dialogues and wooden acting most of the time.Nothing really happens in this movie! Any romantic comedy has to have some stakes in the relationship, some solid drama, and funny, unexpected twists and turns that make sense at least in the fictional universe. In this movie, the conflict that starts Ben and Bea's feud doesn't even make sense! Literally, one minute of simple explanation would clear the air between them, as they are visibly attracted to each other, from the first moment they meet. So the whole basis of this film, that they hate each other, doesn't make sense. We needed some stronger reason for the hate here.Yes, I'm aware that this movie is based on Shakespeare's play 'Much Ado About Nothing', and that one point of that play is that a great fuss/drama between the protagonists started from something insignificant ('nothing'), but every artist, and not only an artist but average person, knows that film is a completely different medium than a theater play, and what worked in a play about romance, written in Shakespeare's times, doesn't work as well in a modern, romantic comedy film. This movie isn't written intelligently enough to make it work either. Again, for the plot to be compelling in this film, we needed a stronger reason for hatred between the main characters, and the development of the characters, and we got neither of those things. Throughout the film, the characters are basic sketches, and we don't know much about them till the end.Then, during the next two, remaining acts of the movie, also nothing really happens. They decide to fake that they are together out of the blue, and their reasons for it are also simply not good enough for the audience to care about the characters and the story. Throughout the entire film, we don't see at all that Ben genuinely desires his ex, and Bea's parents don't have enough of the presence, are completely flat, insignificant characters for the audience to believe or care that she needs to lie to them, which were the two main reasons for the masquerade. Therefore, another giant flaw of the script: the motivations of the main characters that are supposed to push the plot forward are insufficient to be credible and interesting to the audience.In general, the problem is that nothing is fleshed out in 'Anyone but You' - not the main storyline, not the two main leads, not the background characters, drama, or comedy.The 'meta' lines in the script, the kinda 'wink- wink we know it's typical rom-com trope' also don't work because for this to work, the entire script would have to be much more intelligent and satirical, and it isn't smart or a satire at all! It just tried to cheat the audience by doing this, or the writers gave themselves an easy excuse for the rest of their bad writing, and again - it doesn't work. Nothing works in this movie.Yet another big problem: Sydney doesn't have a talent for comedy, sorry. Her delivery is very bland and too stiff, her character is flat, like cut out of a cardboard figure. I just don't understand how someone like her could get the role specifically in romantic comedy if she doesn't fit this role at all. Weren't there some other, better, and actually comedy-talented, cute actresses available during the casting process? Or was it just an easy money grab because it is Sydney Sweeney from 'Euphoria'?Glen is the only one who can be genuinely hilarious and gives his all, and that is not a surprise for anyone who follows his career. Glen already showed his comedy talent in Scream Queens but also proved it as Hangman in Top Gun. He is a very funny guy in real life too, as you can see in his interviews, so it's obvious comedy is natural for him. That's why he absolutely is in his element in this movie, and he 'feels it' but the problem is no one of the rest of the cast is, including Sydney. And Glen alone is still not good enough to save this movie.When you have such a difference in comedic chops between two leads in a romantic comedy that is a giant problem. I don't know if you noticed, but the hilarious thing is, you can already see in the trailers, that Sydney is not good at all in this movie. I remember that I commented her delivery is terrible the minute I watched the trailer!After I watched this movie, I definitely think Glen is much better in romantic comedies when paired with Zoey Deutch. Glen has a way better, more organic, and natural chemistry with Zoey than with Sydney, maybe because Zoey has a comedy talent just like Glen. I saw on Glen's IMDB that he is going to star in another comedy with Zoey, hopefully, better written than this one, so I will wait for it.To sum up, 'Anyone but You' is not worth one second of your time, your money, or any buzz, just wait for the the movie to appear on the streaming platforms. It doesn't have the great main couple, it doesn't have good background characters, it doesn't have the charm, wit, and natural flow that romantic comedies of the '90s or early '2000 had, like She's All That, Love Actually, Holiday, 10 Things I Hate About You, or How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.It simply doesn't have good or even decent writing! And I'm not the enemy of romantic comedies, I'm a woman and aspiring filmmaker, I love great romantic comedies just like any other great movie, of any other genre. But this movie is so bad, that I genuinely felt ashamed while watching it - I felt ashamed for the filmmakers who made this, especially the writers. Don't bother!"
"Anyone But You","SnoopyStyle","24 February 2024",610,"Bea (Sydney Sweeney) meets Ben (Glen Powell) in a coffee shop and they hook up. There are misunderstandings next morning and they leave angry. It turns out that his friend is marrying her sister. The two enemies have to attend a destination wedding in Australia.Sweeney and Powell are trying all kind of broad physical humor. They are both gorgeous and both have good charisma. Neither are outright comedians and that is important. They are mildly funny but are rarely the funniest part. The first big laugh is the WTF old guy while the two bicker. The butt grabbing scene kinda works, but the leads may be overshadowed by a koala. This duo tries very hard.

"Anyone But You","johnnymonsarrat","3 February 2024",410,"Hello again, fellow film travelers.I have to wonder what happened to the writing of this movie. There are some interesting and touching twists to the plot. But mainly it seems plot driven, not character driven. Characters don't make consistent choices with their personality or logic, for example what happens with the parents at the end.The male lead has an acting style that's full of confidence, but he's supposed to be a comic figure that has disabling phobias. God knows why he can barely swim but he can teach diving.The female lead, I take no pleasure in saying this, tends to speak at the other actors instead of to them.I get that the writers were trying to go for a Shakespeare type of thing, like Much Ado About Nothing, but the movie simply wasn't comedic enough to have unconvincing character choices. You can get away with a lot of goofy stuff in a slapstick comedy. But this had mostly drama. So the characters need to make sense.I am sorry. I really wanted to like this.There were hints of genius. There was some good physical comedy and a few touchimg moments. But the cringe worthy flaws buried them."

We left around the halfway mark because I kept hoping that it would improve - a waste of time & our weekly movie budget. The actors were given dialog that was juvenile and scene set-ups that were embarrassing. Lots of gratitious nudity and shots of partial nudity. Anyone interested in seeing this movie should just watch the trailer - it gives viewers a good picture of what they'll see at the theater so they don't waste their time sitting through a really bad movie. It was great seeing Bryan Brown but I wish he had chosen a better vehicle in which to appear than this dreck.

"Anyone But You","DeanAmythe","4 January 2024",410,"Never been into romcoms all that much (I watch movies alone all day as a true cinglephile), though I acknowledge their importance in filling the void for comfort watches: predictable, feel-good, and just the right amount of schmaltz - perfect for a night out (or in). Their template structure isn't so much a concern rather than an obstacle to overcome, which can be achieved with a fun gimmick of some sort, or, simply, by hitting the comedic marks. If this genre wants to see its resurgence these points are vital, and last year's NO HARD FEELINGS was eager to prove that, a return to form yet still raunchy and imbued with a surprising air of maturity - and even when the jokes didn't land, there was still enjoyment to be found in the excellent(ly cast) leads. ANYONE BUT YOU is as back-to-basics as it could get and appears to be, to a certain extent, aware of that, though here the drive to still be its own thing is completely absent. What immediately stands out is the central 'do-they, don't-they', which pretty much feeds directly into the classic plot structure and is barely taken advantage of. When it is being used for comedic purposes, it easily produces the highlights of the film, like the view/spider scene. Most of this, though, is by-the-numbers and safe, lacking any edge or remarkable features aside from the leads' sex appeal (on that front, the quality of the casting is equal to NO HARD FEELINGS). Speaking of them, Powell is as fun as expected - he would most likely be a solid movie star if the current Hollywood system allowed for those - but Sweeney? No clue what she's doing with those line reads, constantly sounding like a bad impression of an American high school girl with a ready disinterest in everything. Not that she has that much to work with anyway, as the script suffers from eye-rollers of jokes, that first half especially bursting with ""did I just say that out loud?"" humor. My sold out screening was awfully silent through most of this, though maybe they were just there for the aforementioned hotties.

I could feel my brain cells dying as I watched this absolute mess of a rom-com.Sydney Sweeney was horrible and has all but ruined her career. She could not make any part of her character believable. Very hard to watch.I'm embarrassed for Brian brown for having anything to do with this movie. He couldn't save this film from disaster.The script jumped all over the place and was so completely unrealistic... not once did the film make me believe any part of it could happen.The film relies on poor humour, And, what they don't show you in the commercials is that it's full of far-left LGBTQ propaganda.I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy."
"Anyone But You","ethanbresnett","6 January 2024",710,"Anyone But You caught me a little bit by surprise I must say. Perhaps that's because my expectations were quite low, but they really needn't have been as this film is a really solid romcom.Primarily this comes from Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney. A romcom lives and dies by its romantic leads, and they are both great in this, nailing the weird and evolving chemistry between their two characters. They are each decently well written, feeling believable and engaging.On top of this, there is a fairly forgettable but perfectly pleasant assortment of supporting characters who add some extra levels of humour to the piece.Speaking of humour, it is a bit hit and miss in this film. There aren't many big laughs, but it is amusing and does have a light and goofy tone throughout that is befitting of any romcom.Now, this film doesn't really reinvent the wheel in any way. It has all the same story beats as most romcoms and doesn't take too many risks. Therefore the plot is fairly mediocre and (as with practically all romcoms) is far too predictable. This never really gets in the way of the fun though, but the inevitable ending does make it feel a teensy bit too long.Overall though I think this is a really solid film. It has a good tone, a couple of engaging leads, and will give you a few laughs too."
"Anyone But You","tm-sheehan","5 January 2024",610,"My Review. Anyone But You
My Rating. 6:10Very very loosely based on Shakespeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"" with even a few quotations in the background and title cards this pleasant enough rom com reminds me of a line from a 16 th Century play The Merchant of Venice by same William Shakespeare, ""All that glisters is not gold"".Which of course translates in today's language ""All that glitters is not gold "".Anyone But You has a pleasant cast set in and around Sydney which is fun to spot locations like the QVB building, and our beautiful harbour vistas and pristine beaches.I was reminded of a far superior Classic romantic comedy ""My Best Friend's Wedding "" 1997 when I saw the actor playing the brides father Dermot Mulroney who achieved great success playing a similar lead 26 years ago to Glen Powell who plays Ben the romantic lead man in this movie.I enjoyed both the young leads Sydney Sweeney who plays Bea and Glen Powell who play the star crossed lovers .The differences and similarities for me in great romance comedies with weddings like My Best Friends Wedding and more recently Crazy Rich Asians is obvious they all look fabulous with surroundings that celebrate the affluence of wealthy privileged people .Where they differ from each other is in the quality of the script writing in this case by Ilana Wolpert and Will Gluck.Light comedy can be clever if it's not pretentious why try and improve on Shakespeare? It's an impossible task.Anyone But You is entertaining but parts of it I found really irritating and contrived.Adding a same sex wedding was a nice modern touch but it's the most heterosexual same sex wedding I've ever seen not one Gay in this village except Claudia and Halle the betrothed couple.The most irritating characters for me were the parents of the brides played by Dermot Mulroney, Rachel Griffiths, Bryan Brown and Michelle Hurd they all seemed to be trying to hard .I can't be to critical of this light comedy that probably appeals to a younger audience demographic than myself .I hope it succeeds overseas as we need to export more home grown cinema product from Australia but we can't just rely on great scenery and cute animal platitudes like winking koalas ."
"Anyone But You","psxexperten","9 February 2024",110,"Horrible, don't waste your time
Weak story, unnecessarily extensive vulgar language, and excessive nudity humiliates the actors. Embarrassing movie that degrades men and women and shows no imagination. It is very sad to believe that this movie appeals to people. Downright stupid with no redeeming qualities.I had respect for some of these actors before I watched this movie. All I can say is that perhaps they will do anything for money. I cannot see any other reason to have participated in this film and I am scared for any teenagers or young adults that are entertained by showing off your body and acting like adolescent fools."
"Anyone But You","movieman6-413-929510","5 January 2024",510,"Anyone But You is a new romantic comedy directed, written and produced in part by Will Gluck, director of Easy A and Friends with Benefits.Bea (Sydney Sweeney) and Ben (Glen Powell) haven't seen each other since a first date. When they are both invited to the same wedding, the two meet again.They learn that people are trying to hook them up so they don't cause further problems during the wedding. This is why they pretend, to get rid of the fuss.Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell have good chemistry together in the film and both know how to play well and playfully with and against each other. Despite their chemistry, the overall film is unfortunately more on the standard side of a romantic comedy. This gives the film game its well-known and predictable sides. Other moments come across as a bit too forced. For co-writer Ilana Wolpert, this is only her first written film story.Another downside of the film is the amount of extra characters. Many of these extras bring their own kind of comedy, but otherwise have little real use in the film. With a few fewer of these extras, the film could have been better focused, with a shorter running time."

Maybe will distract people from her weird acting and that strange way of talking like she has something lodged on her cheeks.Dont waste your money or time in this , go do laundry or try to make that recipe you saved from tik tok.There is a reason they were trying so hard with the promo, EVERYBODY KNEW IT WAS A FLOP."
"Anyone But You","alyetc","28 December 2023",510,"We've seen a million movies set at weddings before - where even the couple getting married gets invested in the main couples status. So I knew a lot of the tropes would be the same, but it was the same but a bit worse. The main couple story I actually really liked, I thought they were hilarious and cute and beat out other movies with the same storyline. It was everything else that fell short. The background characters felt cheesy and fake. All surface level gags or you didn't really get to know them, nothing felt genuine - case in point Bea's parents were incredibly unrealistic, no ones that out of touch. Even Bea's background felt half-done, never explaining why she didn't want law school."

Its repetitive and cliché romantic comedy storyline lacked originality, leaving the audience unengaged. The attempts at humor fell flat, resulting in a tedious and cringe-worthy viewing experience. To add to the disappointment, the lead actress's annoying voice only added to the overall lackluster quality of the film, making it a forgettable and uninspiring cinematic endeavor. Terrible acting and story. I don't understand the high rating of this movie, or the hype. Save your time and skip this one. The movie is downright horrible, with uncomfortable scenes that make you question their choices. Shame on them for delivering such a poorly written script, leading to an overall disappointing and regrettable cinematic experience."
"Anyone But You","barbett-1","1 January 2024",510,"Neither brilliant nor dreadful, ""Anyone But You"" features a cast of characters that are unbelievably attractive and, apparently, insanely wealthy. It stars Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeny's breasts in the formulatic equivalent of a Hallmark Movie knock-off. You know the drill - two perfect young people meet, are instantly attracted to each other, are separated by a misunderstanding with hilarious hijinks ensuing. The misunderstanding is eventually resolved, love blooms once more, and all ends well.What sets this film apart is excellent cinematography with lovely wide-angle views of the Australian countryside. The supporting cast is very capable although the Australian men are played as oafish stereotypes. Glen Powell plays his part well, but Sydney Sweeny appears to be reading her lines from a teleprompter offscreen. Not the worst movie out this holiday season and enjoyable as long as you refrain from high expectations."
"Anyone But You","pkertes-59666","5 January 2024",410,"I went to see this movie because I am a sucker for a romantic comedy, even the average ones (and let's face it, most of them are). Having seen the trailer, I had low expectations, yet this film still managed to come it at an even lower level.Boy meets girl, they hit it off briefly, there is a misunderstanding and when they reconnect through a friend/family wedding, they hate each other. Except as anyone could predict, ultimately they don't really, but it takes an eternity of inauthentic, puerile dross to get there. No tissues needed here.The acting is generally average to poor, and local actors like Rachel Griffiths and Bryan Brown (much of it filmed in Australia) do the minimum required, and are completely wasted here. The script is juvenile, facile and has little in common with reality. The direction is pedestrian and much of the movie is a travel ad for Sydney. Throw in plastic, unlikeable characters and a healthy dose of gratuitous nudity. The attempts at comedy are almost laughable as that, and what little romance eventuates at the end fails to convince after nearly two hours of tripe beforehand.Not recommended, even if you are a fan of the genre."
"Anyone But You","trinaboice","8 January 2024",410,"IN A NUTSHELL:
After an amazing first date, Bea and Ben's fiery attraction turns ice-cold until they find themselves unexpectedly reunited at a destination wedding in Australia that their exes also attend. So, they do what any two mature adults would do: pretend to be a couple amidst the fighting.The film was directed by Will Gluck, who also wrote it with Ilana Wolpert.Ultimately, this is like a rated R Hallmark movie with lots of raunch.THINGS I LIKED:
There is plenty of eye candy here for everyone. The cast is filled with good-looking people and includes Sydney Sweeney, Glen Powell, Alexandra Shipp, Hadley Robinson, GaTa, Michelle Hurd, Dermot Mulroney, Rachel Griffiths, Bryan Brown, and more.Sydney Sweeney was bit by a spider in the movie while filming. That famous clip was posted online and got a lot of stir.We get to visit Australia during the film.The cast is diverse, offering a variety of stories about romance and love.The last scene takes clips from the whole movie and has all of the actors sing the same song for a feel-good moment.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Sure, everyone in the cast is hot, but the script is garbage. It sounded like it was written by a trashy version of Chat GPT.It's supposed to be funny, but it's pathetic how they are instantly super ugly and mean-spirited to each other when they have a miscommunication.It's SUPER predictable.Cliched end-of-movie singing, dancing scene.So much fighting.So many awkward moments.They say the movie is loosely based on Shakepeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"", but I think the Bard would be disgusted by the lack of intelligent language in the script. So many F-bombs. One similarity is that they get a wedding cake from a shop called ""Dogberry's"", which is the name of a character in the play.I cringed and rolled my eyes so many times.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
This movie is definitely not appropriate for kids. It portrays unhealthy relationships and extremely bad behavior.Kids will be completely bored because it's mostly adults talking to each other.Profanity and lots of F-bombs
A lesbian couple kisses and gets married
We see a topless woman
We see several shirtless men
A couple gropes each other inside their shorts.Two women wear bikini tops that barely cover anything.We see a ton of cleavage
A lot of sexual innuendo. We see an unmarried couple in the shower and bed together.We see two men smoke a joint.!"
"Anyone But You","ambusched94","31 December 2023",210,"A forgettable, expendable rom-com where all the somewhat funny, shock value scenes are exposed in the theatrical trailer and there is hardly any laugh-out-loud scenes in this film overall.While Glen Powell has the comedy chops and romantic charm for this film genre, to my astonishment it's the EXACT OPPOSITE for Sydney Sweeney. Her line delivery is dull and she has the same facial expressions, blank stare, dead eyes for most scenes in Anyone But You. You can tell she's acting as in she's not embodying the character in the story and she's simply reading the lines, not conveying any natural nuances in her character each time she does this. Sweeney's crying scene in the taxi felt unnaturally forced. I was surprised her acting was half-a**ed, whereas in the TV series Euphoria (2019-present) her acting feels natural. Or highly likely that she's a limited-range, one-note actress that can only do dark, coming-of-age drama genre and fails at rom-com. IMO, Powell and Sweeney had the most chemistry when their characters were arguing and hating each other. When they got all lovey dovey, the on-screen chemistry felt forced and it was lacking that romantic spark between their characters. I was not invested enough in their progressing relationship to care once they officially got together in the end.So one, I feel like Sweeney largely ruins the film with her bland acting and line delivery, and lack of emotiveness. A better choice for the lead actress in this film should've been a comedic actress or an actress who can deftly juggle comedic timing and dramatic, emotional scenes. If this film was made and released in the 2000s decade for example, Amanda Bynes would be a prime choice for the role of Bea. And two, the character development is lacking and backstory are just tacked-on but don't add any characterization substance. The screenplay pushes the two characters to meet instantaneously at the start of the film, so viewers don't get any individual scenes of each lead character beforehand leaving a lot of character backstory nonexistent. The screenplay gives a brief overlay of each of Ben's and Bea's backstory in a scene montage and it's the error of telling over showing, and it doesn't work, leaving a rushed characterization of both characters that cheapens the film.Supporting characters feel like caricatures and don't add anything to the story. No supporting character was memorable. Some corny dialogue and meta rom-com instances that seem shoehorned in. Also, I wish Darren Barnet (Paxton from the TV series Never Have I Ever (2020-2023)) had more scenes, dialogue and that he would've been the guy Bea ended up with if there was an unexpected surprise, twist ending, instead of the ""enemies to lovers"" and ""stuck together so they'll end up together"" overused romance tropes. But the screenplay is too safe and screenwriters would never be bold enough to rise up to a different, atypical ending like this.I did like that the majority of the film was set in Australia and a few of the songs used in the film's soundtrack.It's ironic that Dermot Mulroney and Rachel Griffiths are in this sucky rom-com when blasting back to the past to 1997, both Mulroney (as the leading man and love interest) and Griffiths (in a supporting role) starred in a first rate quality rom-com, My Best Friend's Wedding. This is why most of my fave rom-coms are from the '90s and the 2000s. When quality storytelling, chemistry, and character development reigned in comparison to this current rom-com garbage.Anyone But You is a derivative, formulaic rom-com that's ultimately unmemorable, vapid rom-com plot, and a waste of time. Just casually watch it once it comes out on streaming if you have nothing else to watch and don't care about draining 1 hour 43 minutes of your time."
"Anyone But You","dogonlion","10 February 2024",110,"Everything in this movie feels forced. The comedy is like ""please laugh, please laugh"". I guess that works on some. Nothing flows naturally. The way they love at first sight and all of the sudden start bickering is unrealistic. The bickering is annoying. Sydney Sweeney is a really good actress, I really liked her in The White Lotus, but she's hasn't been in a movie that uses her full potential yet. The movie is full of cliches. It even has the funny black friend with no love life. I'm really shocked by how much money this movie made. I guess as long as those kinds of movies make money they'll keep the same formula and keep factory produce them and soon will use artificial intelligence to write them."

It had some cute scenes. I gotta say the ensemble was pretty good if I laughed it was always because something one of them said. They were a bunch of goofy characters. I also enjoyed dermot mulroney's character when he was learning how to dive and the reoccurance of that at the end of the movie. It made me giggle.But I gotta say... the dialogue was very mediocre and at times just not good at all. It just lacked depth which again didn't expect it to have depth but still could have been better."

"Anyone But You","masonsaul","30 December 2023",710,"Anyone But You is an enjoyably cynical rom com that still has plenty of heartfelt romance at its centre. Just getting one of these theatrically released currently is kind of a miracle and it plays squarely to the genre's strengths. All its beats are predictable in the best way.Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell are on their way to becoming genuine movie stars and this film only further solidifies that. The constant barbs they send each other's way for the majority of the film are really funny and the chemistry they're constantly trying to deny has a real spark to it.This isn't Will Gluck's first rom com and that's apparent in the good ways. The broad physical comedy is balanced nicely by the snappy wit interspersed throughout and it's surprisingly epic (a lot more helicopter stuff than expected). A good soundtrack always helps with this genre and the one here nails it."

It felt like watching a really cheesy Netflix rom-com but a hundred times worse. The shocking nude scenes just added to its awfulness.I can't get over how bad this is and I really think they just wanted to make something to tick all the boxes of what a rom-com is except it did not tick any of those boxes at all.

"Anyone But You","MichaelByTheSea","26 December 2023",910,"This was like an R rated raunchy Hallmark movie where people actually have sex. I can do without the miscommunication trope that drove apart a couple that seemed to be connecting, but I enjoyed the banter and really enjoyed the stars.""Serious"" critics typically don't appreciate the rom-com genre and judge them harshly. I went with my adult children and we all loved the movie. My kids make fun of my love for Hallmark movies, but even they liked this one. We laughed out loud repeatedly and walked out smiling. I love that feeling.Sure, the script is flawed, the plot's ridiculous, and some of the dialogue is a bit off, but Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney light up the screen with their amazing chemistry. They're extraordinary specimens and look like they spend 6 hours a day in the gym, but I also like them as actors. Glen Powell was really good in another enjoyable modern rom-com with Zoey Deutch called ""Set It Up"" and he's fearless here, especially with the over the top body humor.Sydney Sweeney is certainly voluptuous, and gorgeous to look at, but she's also established herself as a great actress in more critic friendly shows like ""Euphoria"" and ""White Lotus"". Edgy and dark is fine, and it certainly gets taken more seriously by the critics, but I prefer getting lost in an escapist rom-com that doesn't involve terrible people doing terrible things.I want more of this."

"Anyone But You","NatKaminska","28 December 2023",110,"I need to warn those of you who want to spend your money on this thing: don't do it, not worth it. I watched the movie and it was horrible. It tried to be a charming '90s and '2000s rom-com, yet it failed in every department except with the male lead. Glen Powell is the only good thing about this movie.'Anyone but you' is full of cliches and while you can do cliches in a good way, and make genuine, great gem of a specific genre, this is not the case here. The movie is boring, shallow, cringe comedy with typical cringe, over-the-top, not-funny jokes, maybe 1 joke lands in the entire movie, that's how bad it is. The supposedly 'hilarious' nude scene on the cliff, especially the part when Powell is bending over, completely naked, holding his balls in his hands, is the next level of cringe, nothing funny, nothing charming, just cringe, awkward, awful. It's also full of heavy, not subtle, and obvious cultural references as if the writers just wrote down popular internet memes. Man, these writers really don't have any respect for the viewers. I basically wanted to walk out of this movie after the first 15 minutes.The romance part is badly done as well. The chemistry is average at best, just like a normal chemistry between two beautiful people - they are easy on the eyes oh right, like most people in this industry, but nothing more. They are not Mulder and Scully or Hanks and Ryan. Another problem with the main couple is that only Powell is to some degree likable, even tho the script doesn't make his character particularly likable, Powell's natural charisma and charm do the trick. With Sweeney that doesn't exist, she is utterly unlikeable as Bea, and this flaw kills the romance and fun completely. Despite what was said about this duo during the last summer and what some of their blind stans and the media still say now, they don't fit together as a rom-com couple at all!The screenplay itself doesn't help the actors achieve any chemistry, as the entire story is incredibly predictable, and thus boring, with awful dialogues and wooden acting most of the time.Nothing really happens in this movie! Any romantic comedy has to have some stakes in the relationship, some solid drama, and funny, unexpected twists and turns that make sense at least in the fictional universe. In this movie, the conflict that starts Ben and Bea's feud doesn't even make sense! Literally, one minute of simple explanation would clear the air between them, as they are visibly attracted to each other, from the first moment they meet. So the whole basis of this film, that they hate each other, doesn't make sense. We needed some stronger reason for the hate here.Yes, I'm aware that this movie is based on Shakespeare's play 'Much Ado About Nothing', and that one point of that play is that a great fuss/drama between the protagonists started from something insignificant ('nothing'), but every artist, and not only an artist but average person, knows that film is a completely different medium than a theater play, and what worked in a play about romance, written in Shakespeare's times, doesn't work as well in a modern, romantic comedy film. This movie isn't written intelligently enough to make it work either. Again, for the plot to be compelling in this film, we needed a stronger reason for hatred between the main characters, and the development of the characters, and we got neither of those things. Throughout the film, the characters are basic sketches, and we don't know much about them till the end.Then, during the next two, remaining acts of the movie, also nothing really happens. They decide to fake that they are together out of the blue, and their reasons for it are also simply not good enough for the audience to care about the characters and the story. Throughout the entire film, we don't see at all that Ben genuinely desires his ex, and Bea's parents don't have enough of the presence, are completely flat, insignificant characters for the audience to believe or care that she needs to lie to them, which were the two main reasons for the masquerade. Therefore, another giant flaw of the script: the motivations of the main characters that are supposed to push the plot forward are insufficient to be credible and interesting to the audience.In general, the problem is that nothing is fleshed out in 'Anyone but You' - not the main storyline, not the two main leads, not the background characters, drama, or comedy.The 'meta' lines in the script, the kinda 'wink- wink we know it's typical rom-com trope' also don't work because for this to work, the entire script would have to be much more intelligent and satirical, and it isn't smart or a satire at all! It just tried to cheat the audience by doing this, or the writers gave themselves an easy excuse for the rest of their bad writing, and again - it doesn't work. Nothing works in this movie.Yet another big problem: Sydney doesn't have a talent for comedy, sorry. Her delivery is very bland and too stiff, her character is flat, like cut out of a cardboard figure. I just don't understand how someone like her could get the role specifically in romantic comedy if she doesn't fit this role at all. Weren't there some other, better, and actually comedy-talented, cute actresses available during the casting process? Or was it just an easy money grab because it is Sydney Sweeney from 'Euphoria'?Glen is the only one who can be genuinely hilarious and gives his all, and that is not a surprise for anyone who follows his career. Glen already showed his comedy talent in Scream Queens but also proved it as Hangman in Top Gun. He is a very funny guy in real life too, as you can see in his interviews, so it's obvious comedy is natural for him. That's why he absolutely is in his element in this movie, and he 'feels it' but the problem is no one of the rest of the cast is, including Sydney. And Glen alone is still not good enough to save this movie.When you have such a difference in comedic chops between two leads in a romantic comedy that is a giant problem. I don't know if you noticed, but the hilarious thing is, you can already see in the trailers, that Sydney is not good at all in this movie. I remember that I commented her delivery is terrible the minute I watched the trailer!After I watched this movie, I definitely think Glen is much better in romantic comedies when paired with Zoey Deutch. Glen has a way better, more organic, and natural chemistry with Zoey than with Sydney, maybe because Zoey has a comedy talent just like Glen. I saw on Glen's IMDB that he is going to star in another comedy with Zoey, hopefully, better written than this one, so I will wait for it.To sum up, 'Anyone but You' is not worth one second of your time, your money, or any buzz, just wait for the the movie to appear on the streaming platforms. It doesn't have the great main couple, it doesn't have good background characters, it doesn't have the charm, wit, and natural flow that romantic comedies of the '90s or early '2000 had, like She's All That, Love Actually, Holiday, 10 Things I Hate About You, or How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.It simply doesn't have good or even decent writing! And I'm not the enemy of romantic comedies, I'm a woman and aspiring filmmaker, I love great romantic comedies just like any other great movie, of any other genre. But this movie is so bad, that I genuinely felt ashamed while watching it - I felt ashamed for the filmmakers who made this, especially the writers. Don't bother!"
"Anyone But You","SnoopyStyle","24 February 2024",610,"Bea (Sydney Sweeney) meets Ben (Glen Powell) in a coffee shop and they hook up. There are misunderstandings next morning and they leave angry. It turns out that his friend is marrying her sister. The two enemies have to attend a destination wedding in Australia.Sweeney and Powell are trying all kind of broad physical humor. They are both gorgeous and both have good charisma. Neither are outright comedians and that is important. They are mildly funny but are rarely the funniest part. The first big laugh is the WTF old guy while the two bicker. The butt grabbing scene kinda works, but the leads may be overshadowed by a koala. This duo tries very hard. It's so ridiculous that it's mildly funny."
"Anyone But You","johnnymonsarrat","3 February 2024",410,"Hello again, fellow film travelers.I have to wonder what happened to the writing of this movie. There are some interesting and touching twists to the plot. But mainly it seems plot driven, not character driven. Characters don't make consistent choices with their personality or logic, for example what happens with the parents at the end.The male lead has an acting style that's full of confidence, but he's supposed to be a comic figure that has disabling phobias. God knows why he can barely swim but he can teach diving.The female lead, I take no pleasure in saying this, tends to speak at the other actors instead of to them.I get that the writers were trying to go for a Shakespeare type of thing, like Much Ado About Nothing, but the movie simply wasn't comedic enough to have unconvincing character choices. You can get away with a lot of goofy stuff in a slapstick comedy. But this had mostly drama. So the characters need to make sense.I am sorry. I really wanted to like this.There were hints of genius. There was some good physical comedy and a few touchimg moments. But the cringe worthy flaws buried them."
"Anyone But You","gerrgrady-86307","27 December 2023",210,"My husband and I chose this movie as a Saturday treat. We left around the halfway mark because I kept hoping that it would improve - a waste of time & our weekly movie budget. The actors were given dialog that was juvenile and scene set-ups that were embarrassing. Lots of gratitious nudity and shots of partial nudity. Anyone interested in seeing this movie should just watch the trailer - it gives viewers a good picture of what they'll see at the theater so they don't waste their time sitting through a really bad movie. It was great seeing Bryan Brown but I wish he had chosen a better vehicle in which to appear than this dreck. I had greater expections for Glen Powell, but then maybe this is the level of his actual talent. Sad."
"Anyone But You","DeanAmythe","4 January 2024",410,"Never been into romcoms all that much (I watch movies alone all day as a true cinglephile), though I acknowledge their importance in filling the void for comfort watches: predictable, feel-good, and just the right amount of schmaltz - perfect for a night out (or in). Their template structure isn't so much a concern rather than an obstacle to overcome, which can be achieved with a fun gimmick of some sort, or, simply, by hitting the comedic marks. If this genre wants to see its resurgence these points are vital, and last year's NO HARD FEELINGS was eager to prove that, a return to form yet still raunchy and imbued with a surprising air of maturity - and even when the jokes didn't land, there was still enjoyment to be found in the excellent(ly cast) leads. ANYONE BUT YOU is as back-to-basics as it could get and appears to be, to a certain extent, aware of that, though here the drive to still be its own thing is completely absent. What immediately stands out is the central 'do-they, don't-they', which pretty much feeds directly into the classic plot structure and is barely taken advantage of. When it is being used for comedic purposes, it easily produces the highlights of the film, like the view/spider scene. Most of this, though, is by-the-numbers and safe, lacking any edge or remarkable features aside from the leads' sex appeal (on that front, the quality of the casting is equal to NO HARD FEELINGS). Speaking of them, Powell is as fun as expected - he would most likely be a solid movie star if the current Hollywood system allowed for those - but Sweeney? No clue what she's doing with those line reads, constantly sounding like a bad impression of an American high school girl with a ready disinterest in everything. Not that she has that much to work with anyway, as the script suffers from eye-rollers of jokes, that first half especially bursting with ""did I just say that out loud?"" humor. My sold out screening was awfully silent through most of this, though maybe they were just there for the aforementioned hotties. Just so you know: you don't get a (proper) view of Sweeney's melons, but you do get to see a squeezed Australian glans. 4/10."

I could feel my brain cells dying as I watched this absolute mess of a rom-com.Sydney Sweeney was horrible and has all but ruined her career. She could not make any part of her character believable. Very hard to watch.I'm embarrassed for Brian brown for having anything to do with this movie. He couldn't save this film from disaster.The script jumped all over the place and was so completely unrealistic... not once did the film make me believe any part of it could happen.The film relies on poor humour, And, what they don't show you in the commercials is that it's full of far-left LGBTQ propaganda.I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy."
"Anyone But You","ethanbresnett","6 January 2024",710,"Anyone But You caught me a little bit by surprise I must say. Perhaps that's because my expectations were quite low, but they really needn't have been as this film is a really solid romcom.Primarily this comes from Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney. A romcom lives and dies by its romantic leads, and they are both great in this, nailing the weird and evolving chemistry between their two characters. They are each decently well written, feeling believable and engaging.On top of this, there is a fairly forgettable but perfectly pleasant assortment of supporting characters who add some extra levels of humour to the piece.Speaking of humour, it is a bit hit and miss in this film. There aren't many big laughs, but it is amusing and does have a light and goofy tone throughout that is befitting of any romcom.Now, this film doesn't really reinvent the wheel in any way. It has all the same story beats as most romcoms and doesn't take too many risks. Therefore the plot is fairly mediocre and (as with practically all romcoms) is far too predictable. This never really gets in the way of the fun though, but the inevitable ending does make it feel a teensy bit too long.Overall though I think this is a really solid film. It has a good tone, a couple of engaging leads, and will give you a few laughs too."
"Anyone But You","tm-sheehan","5 January 2024",610,"My Review. Anyone But You
My Rating. 6:10Very very loosely based on Shakespeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"" with even a few quotations in the background and title cards this pleasant enough rom com reminds me of a line from a 16 th Century play The Merchant of Venice by same William Shakespeare, ""All that glisters is not gold"".Which of course translates in today's language ""All that glitters is not gold "".Anyone But You has a pleasant cast set in and around Sydney which is fun to spot locations like the QVB building, and our beautiful harbour vistas and pristine beaches.I was reminded of a far superior Classic romantic comedy ""My Best Friend's Wedding "" 1997 when I saw the actor playing the brides father Dermot Mulroney who achieved great success playing a similar lead 26 years ago to Glen Powell who plays Ben the romantic lead man in this movie.I enjoyed both the young leads Sydney Sweeney who plays Bea and Glen Powell who play the star crossed lovers .The differences and similarities for me in great romance comedies with weddings like My Best Friends Wedding and more recently Crazy Rich Asians is obvious they all look fabulous with surroundings that celebrate the affluence of wealthy privileged people .Where they differ from each other is in the quality of the script writing in this case by Ilana Wolpert and Will Gluck.Light comedy can be clever if it's not pretentious why try and improve on Shakespeare? It's an impossible task.Anyone But You is entertaining but parts of it I found really irritating and contrived.Adding a same sex wedding was a nice modern touch but it's the most heterosexual same sex wedding I've ever seen not one Gay in this village except Claudia and Halle the betrothed couple.The most irritating characters for me were the parents of the brides played by Dermot Mulroney, Rachel Griffiths, Bryan Brown and Michelle Hurd they all seemed to be trying to hard .I can't be to critical of this light comedy that probably appeals to a younger audience demographic than myself .I hope it succeeds overseas as we need to export more home grown cinema product from Australia but we can't just rely on great scenery and cute animal platitudes like winking koalas ."
"Anyone But You","psxexperten","9 February 2024",110,"Horrible, don't waste your time
Weak story, unnecessarily extensive vulgar language, and excessive nudity humiliates the actors. Embarrassing movie that degrades men and women and shows no imagination. It is very sad to believe that this movie appeals to people. Downright stupid with no redeeming qualities.I had respect for some of these actors before I watched this movie. All I can say is that perhaps they will do anything for money. I cannot see any other reason to have participated in this film and I am scared for any teenagers or young adults that are entertained by showing off your body and acting like adolescent fools."
"Anyone But You","movieman6-413-929510","5 January 2024",510,"Anyone But You is a new romantic comedy directed, written and produced in part by Will Gluck, director of Easy A and Friends with Benefits.Bea (Sydney Sweeney) and Ben (Glen Powell) haven't seen each other since a first date. When they are both invited to the same wedding, the two meet again.They learn that people are trying to hook them up so they don't cause further problems during the wedding. This is why they pretend, to get rid of the fuss.Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell have good chemistry together in the film and both know how to play well and playfully with and against each other. Despite their chemistry, the overall film is unfortunately more on the standard side of a romantic comedy. This gives the film game its well-known and predictable sides. Other moments come across as a bit too forced. For co-writer Ilana Wolpert, this is only her first written film story.Another downside of the film is the amount of extra characters. Many of these extras bring their own kind of comedy, but otherwise have little real use in the film. With a few fewer of these extras, the film could have been better focused, with a shorter running time."

"Anyone But You","alyetc","28 December 2023",510,"We've seen a million movies set at weddings before - where even the couple getting married gets invested in the main couples status. So I knew a lot of the tropes would be the same, but it was the same but a bit worse. The main couple story I actually really liked, I thought they were hilarious and cute and beat out other movies with the same storyline. It was everything else that fell short. The background characters felt cheesy and fake. All surface level gags or you didn't really get to know them, nothing felt genuine - case in point Bea's parents were incredibly unrealistic, no ones that out of touch. Even Bea's background felt half-done, never explaining why she didn't want law school."

Its repetitive and cliché romantic comedy storyline lacked originality, leaving the audience unengaged. The attempts at humor fell flat, resulting in a tedious and cringe-worthy viewing experience. To add to the disappointment, the lead actress's annoying voice only added to the overall lackluster quality of the film, making it a forgettable and uninspiring cinematic endeavor. Terrible acting and story. I don't understand the high rating of this movie, or the hype. Save your time and skip this one. The movie is downright horrible, with uncomfortable scenes that make you question their choices. Shame on them for delivering such a poorly written script, leading to an overall disappointing and regrettable cinematic experience."
"Anyone But You","barbett-1","1 January 2024",510,"Neither brilliant nor dreadful, ""Anyone But You"" features a cast of characters that are unbelievably attractive and, apparently, insanely wealthy. It stars Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeny's breasts in the formulatic equivalent of a Hallmark Movie knock-off. You know the drill - two perfect young people meet, are instantly attracted to each other, are separated by a misunderstanding with hilarious hijinks ensuing. The misunderstanding is eventually resolved, love blooms once more, and all ends well.What sets this film apart is excellent cinematography with lovely wide-angle views of the Australian countryside. The supporting cast is very capable although the Australian men are played as oafish stereotypes. Glen Powell plays his part well, but Sydney Sweeny appears to be reading her lines from a teleprompter offscreen. Not the worst movie out this holiday season and enjoyable as long as you refrain from high expectations."
"Anyone But You","pkertes-59666","5 January 2024",410,"I went to see this movie because I am a sucker for a romantic comedy, even the average ones (and let's face it, most of them are). Having seen the trailer, I had low expectations, yet this film still managed to come it at an even lower level.Boy meets girl, they hit it off briefly, there is a misunderstanding and when they reconnect through a friend/family wedding, they hate each other. Except as anyone could predict, ultimately they don't really, but it takes an eternity of inauthentic, puerile dross to get there. No tissues needed here.The acting is generally average to poor, and local actors like Rachel Griffiths and Bryan Brown (much of it filmed in Australia) do the minimum required, and are completely wasted here. The script is juvenile, facile and has little in common with reality. The direction is pedestrian and much of the movie is a travel ad for Sydney. Throw in plastic, unlikeable characters and a healthy dose of gratuitous nudity. The attempts at comedy are almost laughable as that, and what little romance eventuates at the end fails to convince after nearly two hours of tripe beforehand.Not recommended, even if you are a fan of the genre."
"Anyone But You","trinaboice","8 January 2024",410,"IN A NUTSHELL:
After an amazing first date, Bea and Ben's fiery attraction turns ice-cold until they find themselves unexpectedly reunited at a destination wedding in Australia that their exes also attend. So, they do what any two mature adults would do: pretend to be a couple amidst the fighting.The film was directed by Will Gluck, who also wrote it with Ilana Wolpert.Ultimately, this is like a rated R Hallmark movie with lots of raunch.THINGS I LIKED:
There is plenty of eye candy here for everyone. The cast is filled with good-looking people and includes Sydney Sweeney, Glen Powell, Alexandra Shipp, Hadley Robinson, GaTa, Michelle Hurd, Dermot Mulroney, Rachel Griffiths, Bryan Brown, and more.Sydney Sweeney was bit by a spider in the movie while filming. That famous clip was posted online and got a lot of stir.We get to visit Australia during the film.The cast is diverse, offering a variety of stories about romance and love.The last scene takes clips from the whole movie and has all of the actors sing the same song for a feel-good moment.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Sure, everyone in the cast is hot, but the script is garbage. It sounded like it was written by a trashy version of Chat GPT.It's supposed to be funny, but it's pathetic how they are instantly super ugly and mean-spirited to each other when they have a miscommunication.It's SUPER predictable.Cliched end-of-movie singing, dancing scene.So much fighting.So many awkward moments.They say the movie is loosely based on Shakepeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"", but I think the Bard would be disgusted by the lack of intelligent language in the script. So many F-bombs. One similarity is that they get a wedding cake from a shop called ""Dogberry's"", which is the name of a character in the play.I cringed and rolled my eyes so many times.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
This movie is definitely not appropriate for kids. It portrays unhealthy relationships and extremely bad behavior.Kids will be completely bored because it's mostly adults talking to each other.Profanity and lots of F-bombs
A lesbian couple kisses and gets married
We see a topless woman
We see several shirtless men
A couple gropes each other inside their shorts.Two women wear bikini tops that barely cover anything.We see a ton of cleavage
A lot of sexual innuendo. We see an unmarried couple in the shower and bed together.We see two men smoke a joint.!"
"Anyone But You","ambusched94","31 December 2023",210,"A forgettable, expendable rom-com where all the somewhat funny, shock value scenes are exposed in the theatrical trailer and there is hardly any laugh-out-loud scenes in this film overall.While Glen Powell has the comedy chops and romantic charm for this film genre, to my astonishment it's the EXACT OPPOSITE for Sydney Sweeney. Her line delivery is dull and she has the same facial expressions, blank stare, dead eyes for most scenes in Anyone But You. You can tell she's acting as in she's not embodying the character in the story and she's simply reading the lines, not conveying any natural nuances in her character each time she does this. Sweeney's crying scene in the taxi felt unnaturally forced. I was surprised her acting was half-a**ed, whereas in the TV series Euphoria (2019-present) her acting feels natural. Or highly likely that she's a limited-range, one-note actress that can only do dark, coming-of-age drama genre and fails at rom-com. IMO, Powell and Sweeney had the most chemistry when their characters were arguing and hating each other. When they got all lovey dovey, the on-screen chemistry felt forced and it was lacking that romantic spark between their characters. I was not invested enough in their progressing relationship to care once they officially got together in the end.So one, I feel like Sweeney largely ruins the film with her bland acting and line delivery, and lack of emotiveness. A better choice for the lead actress in this film should've been a comedic actress or an actress who can deftly juggle comedic timing and dramatic, emotional scenes. If this film was made and released in the 2000s decade for example, Amanda Bynes would be a prime choice for the role of Bea. And two, the character development is lacking and backstory are just tacked-on but don't add any characterization substance. The screenplay pushes the two characters to meet instantaneously at the start of the film, so viewers don't get any individual scenes of each lead character beforehand leaving a lot of character backstory nonexistent. The screenplay gives a brief overlay of each of Ben's and Bea's backstory in a scene montage and it's the error of telling over showing, and it doesn't work, leaving a rushed characterization of both characters that cheapens the film.Supporting characters feel like caricatures and don't add anything to the story. No supporting character was memorable. Some corny dialogue and meta rom-com instances that seem shoehorned in. Also, I wish Darren Barnet (Paxton from the TV series Never Have I Ever (2020-2023)) had more scenes, dialogue and that he would've been the guy Bea ended up with if there was an unexpected surprise, twist ending, instead of the ""enemies to lovers"" and ""stuck together so they'll end up together"" overused romance tropes. But the screenplay is too safe and screenwriters would never be bold enough to rise up to a different, atypical ending like this.I did like that the majority of the film was set in Australia and a few of the songs used in the film's soundtrack.It's ironic that Dermot Mulroney and Rachel Griffiths are in this sucky rom-com when blasting back to the past to 1997, both Mulroney (as the leading man and love interest) and Griffiths (in a supporting role) starred in a first rate quality rom-com, My Best Friend's Wedding. This is why most of my fave rom-coms are from the '90s and the 2000s. When quality storytelling, chemistry, and character development reigned in comparison to this current rom-com garbage.Anyone But You is a derivative, formulaic rom-com that's ultimately unmemorable, vapid rom-com plot, and a waste of time. Just casually watch it once it comes out on streaming if you have nothing else to watch and don't care about draining 1 hour 43 minutes of your time."
"Anyone But You","dogonlion","10 February 2024",110,"Everything in this movie feels forced. The comedy is like ""please laugh, please laugh"". I guess that works on some. Nothing flows naturally. The way they love at first sight and all of the sudden start bickering is unrealistic. The bickering is annoying. Sydney Sweeney is a really good actress, I really liked her in The White Lotus, but she's hasn't been in a movie that uses her full potential yet. The movie is full of cliches. It even has the funny black friend with no love life. I'm really shocked by how much money this movie made.

It had some cute scenes. I gotta say the ensemble was pretty good if I laughed it was always because something one of them said. They were a bunch of goofy characters. I also enjoyed dermot mulroney's character when he was learning how to dive and the reoccurance of that at the end of the movie.

Just getting one of these theatrically released currently is kind of a miracle and it plays squarely to the genre's strengths. All its beats are predictable in the best way.Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell are on their way to becoming genuine movie stars and this film only further solidifies that. The constant barbs they send each other's way for the majority of the film are really funny and the chemistry they're constantly trying to deny has a real spark to it.This isn't Will Gluck's first rom com and that's apparent in the good ways. The broad physical comedy is balanced nicely by the snappy wit interspersed throughout and it's surprisingly epic (a lot more helicopter stuff than expected).

I went with my adult children and we all loved the movie. My kids make fun of my love for Hallmark movies, but even they liked this one. We laughed out loud repeatedly and walked out smiling. I love that feeling.Sure, the script is flawed, the plot's ridiculous, and some of the dialogue is a bit off, but Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney light up the screen with their amazing chemistry. They're extraordinary specimens and look like they spend 6 hours a day in the gym, but I also like them as actors. Glen Powell was really good in another enjoyable modern rom-com with Zoey Deutch called ""Set It Up"" and he's fearless here, especially with the over the top body humor.Sydney Sweeney is certainly voluptuous, and gorgeous to look at, but she's also established herself as a great actress in more critic friendly shows like ""Euphoria"" and ""White Lotus"". Edgy and dark is fine, and it certainly gets taken more seriously by the critics, but I prefer getting lost in an escapist rom-com that doesn't involve terrible people doing terrible things.I want more of this."

Glen Powell is the only good thing about this movie.'Anyone but you' is full of cliches and while you can do cliches in a good way, and make genuine, great gem of a specific genre, this is not the case here. The movie is boring, shallow, cringe comedy with typical cringe, over-the-top, not-funny jokes, maybe 1 joke lands in the entire movie, that's how bad it is. The supposedly 'hilarious' nude scene on the cliff, especially the part when Powell is bending over, completely naked, holding his balls in his hands, is the next level of cringe, nothing funny, nothing charming, just cringe, awkward, awful. It's also full of heavy, not subtle, and obvious cultural references as if the writers just wrote down popular internet memes. Man, these writers really don't have any respect for the viewers. I basically wanted to walk out of this movie after the first 15 minutes.The romance part is badly done as well. The chemistry is average at best, just like a normal chemistry between two beautiful people - they are easy on the eyes oh right, like most people in this industry, but nothing more. They are not Mulder and Scully or Hanks and Ryan. Another problem with the main couple is that only Powell is to some degree likable, even tho the script doesn't make his character particularly likable, Powell's natural charisma and charm do the trick. With Sweeney that doesn't exist, she is utterly unlikeable as Bea, and this flaw kills the romance and fun completely. Despite what was said about this duo during the last summer and what some of their blind stans and the media still say now, they don't fit together as a rom-com couple at all!The screenplay itself doesn't help the actors achieve any chemistry, as the entire story is incredibly predictable, and thus boring, with awful dialogues and wooden acting most of the time.Nothing really happens in this movie! Any romantic comedy has to have some stakes in the relationship, some solid drama, and funny, unexpected twists and turns that make sense at least in the fictional universe. In this movie, the conflict that starts Ben and Bea's feud doesn't even make sense! Literally, one minute of simple explanation would clear the air between them, as they are visibly attracted to each other, from the first moment they meet. So the whole basis of this film, that they hate each other, doesn't make sense. We needed some stronger reason for the hate here.Yes, I'm aware that this movie is based on Shakespeare's play 'Much Ado About Nothing', and that one point of that play is that a great fuss/drama between the protagonists started from something insignificant ('nothing'), but every artist, and not only an artist but average person, knows that film is a completely different medium than a theater play, and what worked in a play about romance, written in Shakespeare's times, doesn't work as well in a modern, romantic comedy film. This movie isn't written intelligently enough to make it work either. Again, for the plot to be compelling in this film, we needed a stronger reason for hatred between the main characters, and the development of the characters, and we got neither of those things. Throughout the film, the characters are basic sketches, and we don't know much about them till the end.Then, during the next two, remaining acts of the movie, also nothing really happens. They decide to fake that they are together out of the blue, and their reasons for it are also simply not good enough for the audience to care about the characters and the story. Throughout the entire film, we don't see at all that Ben genuinely desires his ex, and Bea's parents don't have enough of the presence, are completely flat, insignificant characters for the audience to believe or care that she needs to lie to them, which were the two main reasons for the masquerade. Therefore, another giant flaw of the script: the motivations of the main characters that are supposed to push the plot forward are insufficient to be credible and interesting to the audience.In general, the problem is that nothing is fleshed out in 'Anyone but You' - not the main storyline, not the two main leads, not the background characters, drama, or comedy.The 'meta' lines in the script, the kinda 'wink- wink we know it's typical rom-com trope' also don't work because for this to work, the entire script would have to be much more intelligent and satirical, and it isn't smart or a satire at all! It just tried to cheat the audience by doing this, or the writers gave themselves an easy excuse for the rest of their bad writing, and again - it doesn't work. Nothing works in this movie.Yet another big problem: Sydney doesn't have a talent for comedy, sorry. Her delivery is very bland and too stiff, her character is flat, like cut out of a cardboard figure. I just don't understand how someone like her could get the role specifically in romantic comedy if she doesn't fit this role at all. Weren't there some other, better, and actually comedy-talented, cute actresses available during the casting process? Or was it just an easy money grab because it is Sydney Sweeney from 'Euphoria'?Glen is the only one who can be genuinely hilarious and gives his all, and that is not a surprise for anyone who follows his career. Glen already showed his comedy talent in Scream Queens but also proved it as Hangman in Top Gun. He is a very funny guy in real life too, as you can see in his interviews, so it's obvious comedy is natural for him. That's why he absolutely is in his element in this movie, and he 'feels it' but the problem is no one of the rest of the cast is, including Sydney. And Glen alone is still not good enough to save this movie.When you have such a difference in comedic chops between two leads in a romantic comedy that is a giant problem. I don't know if you noticed, but the hilarious thing is, you can already see in the trailers, that Sydney is not good at all in this movie. I remember that I commented her delivery is terrible the minute I watched the trailer!After I watched this movie, I definitely think Glen is much better in romantic comedies when paired with Zoey Deutch. Glen has a way better, more organic, and natural chemistry with Zoey than with Sydney, maybe because Zoey has a comedy talent just like Glen. I saw on Glen's IMDB that he is going to star in another comedy with Zoey, hopefully, better written than this one, so I will wait for it.To sum up, 'Anyone but You' is not worth one second of your time, your money, or any buzz, just wait for the the movie to appear on the streaming platforms. It doesn't have the great main couple, it doesn't have good background characters, it doesn't have the charm, wit, and natural flow that romantic comedies of the '90s or early '2000 had, like She's All That, Love Actually, Holiday, 10 Things I Hate About You, or How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.It simply doesn't have good or even decent writing! And I'm not the enemy of romantic comedies, I'm a woman and aspiring filmmaker, I love great romantic comedies just like any other great movie, of any other genre. But this movie is so bad, that I genuinely felt ashamed while watching it - I felt ashamed for the filmmakers who made this, especially the writers. Don't bother!"
"Anyone But You","SnoopyStyle","24 February 2024",610,"Bea (Sydney Sweeney) meets Ben (Glen Powell) in a coffee shop and they hook up. There are misunderstandings next morning and they leave angry. It turns out that his friend is marrying her sister. The two enemies have to attend a destination wedding in Australia.Sweeney and Powell are trying all kind of broad physical humor. They are both gorgeous and both have good charisma. Neither are outright comedians and that is important. They are mildly funny but are rarely the funniest part. The first big laugh is the WTF old guy while the two bicker. The butt grabbing scene kinda works, but the leads may be overshadowed by a koala. This duo tries very hard. It's so ridiculous that it's mildly funny."
"Anyone But You","johnnymonsarrat","3 February 2024",410,"Hello again, fellow film travelers.I have to wonder what happened to the writing of this movie. There are some interesting and touching twists to the plot. But mainly it seems plot driven, not character driven. Characters don't make consistent choices with their personality or logic, for example what happens with the parents at the end.The male lead has an acting style that's full of confidence, but he's supposed to be a comic figure that has disabling phobias. God knows why he can barely swim but he can teach diving.The female lead, I take no pleasure in saying this, tends to speak at the other actors instead of to them.I get that the writers were trying to go for a Shakespeare type of thing, like Much Ado About Nothing, but the movie simply wasn't comedic enough to have unconvincing character choices. You can get away with a lot of goofy stuff in a slapstick comedy. But this had mostly drama. So the characters need to make sense.I am sorry. I really wanted to like this.There were hints of genius. There was some good physical comedy and a few touchimg moments. But the cringe worthy flaws buried them."
"Anyone But You","gerrgrady-86307","27 December 2023",210,"My husband and I chose this movie as a Saturday treat. We left around the halfway mark because I kept hoping that it would improve - a waste of time & our weekly movie budget. The actors were given dialog that was juvenile and scene set-ups that were embarrassing. Lots of gratitious nudity and shots of partial nudity. Anyone interested in seeing this movie should just watch the trailer - it gives viewers a good picture of what they'll see at the theater so they don't waste their time sitting through a really bad movie. It was great seeing Bryan Brown but I wish he had chosen a better vehicle in which to appear than this dreck. I had greater expections for Glen Powell, but then maybe this is the level of his actual talent. Sad."
"Anyone But You","DeanAmythe","4 January 2024",410,"Never been into romcoms all that much (I watch movies alone all day as a true cinglephile), though I acknowledge their importance in filling the void for comfort watches: predictable, feel-good, and just the right amount of schmaltz - perfect for a night out (or in). Their template structure isn't so much a concern rather than an obstacle to overcome, which can be achieved with a fun gimmick of some sort, or, simply, by hitting the comedic marks. If this genre wants to see its resurgence these points are vital, and last year's NO HARD FEELINGS was eager to prove that, a return to form yet still raunchy and imbued with a surprising air of maturity - and even when the jokes didn't land, there was still enjoyment to be found in the excellent(ly cast) leads. ANYONE BUT YOU is as back-to-basics as it could get and appears to be, to a certain extent, aware of that, though here the drive to still be its own thing is completely absent. What immediately stands out is the central 'do-they, don't-they', which pretty much feeds directly into the classic plot structure and is barely taken advantage of. When it is being used for comedic purposes, it easily produces the highlights of the film, like the view/spider scene. Most of this, though, is by-the-numbers and safe, lacking any edge or remarkable features aside from the leads' sex appeal (on that front, the quality of the casting is equal to NO HARD FEELINGS). Speaking of them, Powell is as fun as expected - he would most likely be a solid movie star if the current Hollywood system allowed for those - but Sweeney? No clue what she's doing with those line reads, constantly sounding like a bad impression of an American high school girl with a ready disinterest in everything. Not that she has that much to work with anyway, as the script suffers from eye-rollers of jokes, that first half especially bursting with ""did I just say that out loud?"" humor. My sold out screening was awfully silent through most of this, though maybe they were just there for the aforementioned hotties. Just so you know: you don't get a (proper) view of Sweeney's melons, but you do get to see a squeezed Australian glans. 4/10."
"Anyone But You","jaynzsarah-561-359737","10 February 2024",110,"Launch a cannon to your head.This is one of the worst films I have ever had the misfortune to watch. I could feel my brain cells dying as I watched this absolute mess of a rom-com.Sydney Sweeney was horrible and has all but ruined her career. She could not make any part of her character believable. Very hard to watch.I'm embarrassed for Brian brown for having anything to do with this movie. He couldn't save this film from disaster.The script jumped all over the place and was so completely unrealistic... not once did the film make me believe any part of it could happen.The film relies on poor humour, And, what they don't show you in the commercials is that it's full of far-left LGBTQ propaganda.I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy."
"Anyone But You","ethanbresnett","6 January 2024",710,"Anyone But You caught me a little bit by surprise I must say. Perhaps that's because my expectations were quite low, but they really needn't have been as this film is a really solid romcom.Primarily this comes from Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney. A romcom lives and dies by its romantic leads, and they are both great in this, nailing the weird and evolving chemistry between their two characters. They are each decently well written, feeling believable and engaging.On top of this, there is a fairly forgettable but perfectly pleasant assortment of supporting characters who add some extra levels of humour to the piece.Speaking of humour, it is a bit hit and miss in this film. There aren't many big laughs, but it is amusing and does have a light and goofy tone throughout that is befitting of any romcom.Now, this film doesn't really reinvent the wheel in any way. It has all the same story beats as most romcoms and doesn't take too many risks. Therefore the plot is fairly mediocre and (as with practically all romcoms) is far too predictable. This never really gets in the way of the fun though, but the inevitable ending does make it feel a teensy bit too long.Overall though I think this is a really solid film. It has a good tone, a couple of engaging leads, and will give you a few laughs too."
"Anyone But You","tm-sheehan","5 January 2024",610,"My Review. Anyone But You
My Rating. 6:10Very very loosely based on Shakespeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"" with even a few quotations in the background and title cards this pleasant enough rom com reminds me of a line from a 16 th Century play The Merchant of Venice by same William Shakespeare, ""All that glisters is not gold"".Which of course translates in today's language ""All that glitters is not gold "".Anyone But You has a pleasant cast set in and around Sydney which is fun to spot locations like the QVB building, and our beautiful harbour vistas and pristine beaches.I was reminded of a far superior Classic romantic comedy ""My Best Friend's Wedding "" 1997 when I saw the actor playing the brides father Dermot Mulroney who achieved great success playing a similar lead 26 years ago to Glen Powell who plays Ben the romantic lead man in this movie.I enjoyed both the young leads Sydney Sweeney who plays Bea and Glen Powell who play the star crossed lovers .The differences and similarities for me in great romance comedies with weddings like My Best Friends Wedding and more recently Crazy Rich Asians is obvious they all look fabulous with surroundings that celebrate the affluence of wealthy privileged people .Where they differ from each other is in the quality of the script writing in this case by Ilana Wolpert and Will Gluck.Light comedy can be clever if it's not pretentious why try and improve on Shakespeare? It's an impossible task.Anyone But You is entertaining but parts of it I found really irritating and contrived.Adding a same sex wedding was a nice modern touch but it's the most heterosexual same sex wedding I've ever seen not one Gay in this village except Claudia and Halle the betrothed couple.The most irritating characters for me were the parents of the brides played by Dermot Mulroney, Rachel Griffiths, Bryan Brown and Michelle Hurd they all seemed to be trying to hard .I can't be to critical of this light comedy that probably appeals to a younger audience demographic than myself .I hope it succeeds overseas as we need to export more home grown cinema product from Australia but we can't just rely on great scenery and cute animal platitudes like winking koalas ."
"Anyone But You","psxexperten","9 February 2024",110,"Horrible, don't waste your time
Weak story, unnecessarily extensive vulgar language, and excessive nudity humiliates the actors. Embarrassing movie that degrades men and women and shows no imagination. It is very sad to believe that this movie appeals to people. Downright stupid with no redeeming qualities.I had respect for some of these actors before I watched this movie. All I can say is that perhaps they will do anything for money. I cannot see any other reason to have participated in this film and I am scared for any teenagers or young adults that are entertained by showing off your body and acting like adolescent fools."
"Anyone But You","movieman6-413-929510","5 January 2024",510,"Anyone But You is a new romantic comedy directed, written and produced in part by Will Gluck, director of Easy A and Friends with Benefits.Bea (Sydney Sweeney) and Ben (Glen Powell) haven't seen each other since a first date. When they are both invited to the same wedding, the two meet again.They learn that people are trying to hook them up so they don't cause further problems during the wedding. This is why they pretend, to get rid of the fuss.Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell have good chemistry together in the film and both know how to play well and playfully with and against each other. Despite their chemistry, the overall film is unfortunately more on the standard side of a romantic comedy. This gives the film game its well-known and predictable sides. Other moments come across as a bit too forced. For co-writer Ilana Wolpert, this is only her first written film story.Another downside of the film is the amount of extra characters. Many of these extras bring their own kind of comedy, but otherwise have little real use in the film. With a few fewer of these extras, the film could have been better focused, with a shorter running time."

Maybe will distract people from her weird acting and that strange way of talking like she has something lodged on her cheeks.Dont waste your money or time in this , go do laundry or try to make that recipe you saved from tik tok.There is a reason they were trying so hard with the promo, EVERYBODY KNEW IT WAS A FLOP."
"Anyone But You","alyetc","28 December 2023",510,"We've seen a million movies set at weddings before - where even the couple getting married gets invested in the main couples status. So I knew a lot of the tropes would be the same, but it was the same but a bit worse. The main couple story I actually really liked, I thought they were hilarious and cute and beat out other movies with the same storyline. It was everything else that fell short. The background characters felt cheesy and fake. All surface level gags or you didn't really get to know them, nothing felt genuine - case in point Bea's parents were incredibly unrealistic, no ones that out of touch. Even Bea's background felt half-done, never explaining why she didn't want law school."
"Anyone But You","STARONTHETOPOFTHESKY","11 February 2024",110,"The movie, unfortunately, failed to deliver on multiple fronts. Its repetitive and cliché romantic comedy storyline lacked originality, leaving the audience unengaged. The attempts at humor fell flat, resulting in a tedious and cringe-worthy viewing experience. To add to the disappointment, the lead actress's annoying voice only added to the overall lackluster quality of the film, making it a forgettable and uninspiring cinematic endeavor. Terrible acting and story. I don't understand the high rating of this movie, or the hype. Save your time and skip this one. The movie is downright horrible, with uncomfortable scenes that make you question their choices. Shame on them for delivering such a poorly written script, leading to an overall disappointing and regrettable cinematic experience."
"Anyone But You","barbett-1","1 January 2024",510,"Neither brilliant nor dreadful, ""Anyone But You"" features a cast of characters that are unbelievably attractive and, apparently, insanely wealthy. It stars Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeny's breasts in the formulatic equivalent of a Hallmark Movie knock-off. You know the drill - two perfect young people meet, are instantly attracted to each other, are separated by a misunderstanding with hilarious hijinks ensuing. The misunderstanding is eventually resolved, love blooms once more, and all ends well.What sets this film apart is excellent cinematography with lovely wide-angle views of the Australian countryside. The supporting cast is very capable although the Australian men are played as oafish stereotypes. Glen Powell plays his part well, but Sydney Sweeny appears to be reading her lines from a teleprompter offscreen. Not the worst movie out this holiday season and enjoyable as long as you refrain from high expectations."
"Anyone But You","pkertes-59666","5 January 2024",410,"I went to see this movie because I am a sucker for a romantic comedy, even the average ones (and let's face it, most of them are). Having seen the trailer, I had low expectations, yet this film still managed to come it at an even lower level.Boy meets girl, they hit it off briefly, there is a misunderstanding and when they reconnect through a friend/family wedding, they hate each other. Except as anyone could predict, ultimately they don't really, but it takes an eternity of inauthentic, puerile dross to get there. No tissues needed here.The acting is generally average to poor, and local actors like Rachel Griffiths and Bryan Brown (much of it filmed in Australia) do the minimum required, and are completely wasted here. The script is juvenile, facile and has little in common with reality. The direction is pedestrian and much of the movie is a travel ad for Sydney. Throw in plastic, unlikeable characters and a healthy dose of gratuitous nudity. The attempts at comedy are almost laughable as that, and what little romance eventuates at the end fails to convince after nearly two hours of tripe beforehand.Not recommended, even if you are a fan of the genre."
"Anyone But You","trinaboice","8 January 2024",410,"IN A NUTSHELL:
After an amazing first date, Bea and Ben's fiery attraction turns ice-cold until they find themselves unexpectedly reunited at a destination wedding in Australia that their exes also attend. So, they do what any two mature adults would do: pretend to be a couple amidst the fighting.The film was directed by Will Gluck, who also wrote it with Ilana Wolpert.Ultimately, this is like a rated R Hallmark movie with lots of raunch.THINGS I LIKED:
There is plenty of eye candy here for everyone. The cast is filled with good-looking people and includes Sydney Sweeney, Glen Powell, Alexandra Shipp, Hadley Robinson, GaTa, Michelle Hurd, Dermot Mulroney, Rachel Griffiths, Bryan Brown, and more.Sydney Sweeney was bit by a spider in the movie while filming. That famous clip was posted online and got a lot of stir.We get to visit Australia during the film.The cast is diverse, offering a variety of stories about romance and love.The last scene takes clips from the whole movie and has all of the actors sing the same song for a feel-good moment.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Sure, everyone in the cast is hot, but the script is garbage. It sounded like it was written by a trashy version of Chat GPT.It's supposed to be funny, but it's pathetic how they are instantly super ugly and mean-spirited to each other when they have a miscommunication.It's SUPER predictable.Cliched end-of-movie singing, dancing scene.So much fighting.So many awkward moments.They say the movie is loosely based on Shakepeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"", but I think the Bard would be disgusted by the lack of intelligent language in the script. So many F-bombs. One similarity is that they get a wedding cake from a shop called ""Dogberry's"", which is the name of a character in the play.I cringed and rolled my eyes so many times.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
This movie is definitely not appropriate for kids. It portrays unhealthy relationships and extremely bad behavior.Kids will be completely bored because it's mostly adults talking to each other.Profanity and lots of F-bombs
A lesbian couple kisses and gets married
We see a topless woman
We see several shirtless men
A couple gropes each other inside their shorts.Two women wear bikini tops that barely cover anything.We see a ton of cleavage
A lot of sexual innuendo. We see an unmarried couple in the shower and bed together.We see two men smoke a joint.!"
"Anyone But You","ambusched94","31 December 2023",210,"A forgettable, expendable rom-com where all the somewhat funny, shock value scenes are exposed in the theatrical trailer and there is hardly any laugh-out-loud scenes in this film overall.While Glen Powell has the comedy chops and romantic charm for this film genre, to my astonishment it's the EXACT OPPOSITE for Sydney Sweeney. Her line delivery is dull and she has the same facial expressions, blank stare, dead eyes for most scenes in Anyone But You. You can tell she's acting as in she's not embodying the character in the story and she's simply reading the lines, not conveying any natural nuances in her character each time she does this. Sweeney's crying scene in the taxi felt unnaturally forced. I was surprised her acting was half-a**ed, whereas in the TV series Euphoria (2019-present) her acting feels natural. Or highly likely that she's a limited-range, one-note actress that can only do dark, coming-of-age drama genre and fails at rom-com. IMO, Powell and Sweeney had the most chemistry when their characters were arguing and hating each other. When they got all lovey dovey, the on-screen chemistry felt forced and it was lacking that romantic spark between their characters. I was not invested enough in their progressing relationship to care once they officially got together in the end.So one, I feel like Sweeney largely ruins the film with her bland acting and line delivery, and lack of emotiveness. A better choice for the lead actress in this film should've been a comedic actress or an actress who can deftly juggle comedic timing and dramatic, emotional scenes. If this film was made and released in the 2000s decade for example, Amanda Bynes would be a prime choice for the role of Bea. And two, the character development is lacking and backstory are just tacked-on but don't add any characterization substance. The screenplay pushes the two characters to meet instantaneously at the start of the film, so viewers don't get any individual scenes of each lead character beforehand leaving a lot of character backstory nonexistent. The screenplay gives a brief overlay of each of Ben's and Bea's backstory in a scene montage and it's the error of telling over showing, and it doesn't work, leaving a rushed characterization of both characters that cheapens the film.Supporting characters feel like caricatures and don't add anything to the story. No supporting character was memorable. Some corny dialogue and meta rom-com instances that seem shoehorned in. Also, I wish Darren Barnet (Paxton from the TV series Never Have I Ever (2020-2023)) had more scenes, dialogue and that he would've been the guy Bea ended up with if there was an unexpected surprise, twist ending, instead of the ""enemies to lovers"" and ""stuck together so they'll end up together"" overused romance tropes. But the screenplay is too safe and screenwriters would never be bold enough to rise up to a different, atypical ending like this.I did like that the majority of the film was set in Australia and a few of the songs used in the film's soundtrack.It's ironic that Dermot Mulroney and Rachel Griffiths are in this sucky rom-com when blasting back to the past to 1997, both Mulroney (as the leading man and love interest) and Griffiths (in a supporting role) starred in a first rate quality rom-com, My Best Friend's Wedding. This is why most of my fave rom-coms are from the '90s and the 2000s. When quality storytelling, chemistry, and character development reigned in comparison to this current rom-com garbage.Anyone But You is a derivative, formulaic rom-com that's ultimately unmemorable, vapid rom-com plot, and a waste of time. Just casually watch it once it comes out on streaming if you have nothing else to watch and don't care about draining 1 hour 43 minutes of your time."
"Anyone But You","dogonlion","10 February 2024",110,"Everything in this movie feels forced. The comedy is like ""please laugh, please laugh"". I guess that works on some. Nothing flows naturally. The way they love at first sight and all of the sudden start bickering is unrealistic. The bickering is annoying. Sydney Sweeney is a really good actress, I really liked her in The White Lotus, but she's hasn't been in a movie that uses her full potential yet. The movie is full of cliches. It even has the funny black friend with no love life. I'm really shocked by how much money this movie made. I guess as long as those kinds of movies make money they'll keep the same formula and keep factory produce them and soon will use artificial intelligence to write them."

It had some cute scenes. I gotta say the ensemble was pretty good if I laughed it was always because something one of them said. They were a bunch of goofy characters. I also enjoyed dermot mulroney's character when he was learning how to dive and the reoccurance of that at the end of the movie. It made me giggle.But I gotta say... the dialogue was very mediocre and at times just not good at all. It just lacked depth which again didn't expect it to have depth but still could have been better."

Overall, an incredibly formulaic Rom-Com that tries way too hard to capitalize on the popularity and looks of Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney, but fails hard as it is so predictable and barely funny.Bad Direction (The whole movie just feels like the studio shelled out something to tick boxes rather than make a well thought-out comedy (this included plot concepts, wardrobing, and jokes) because that's what they think the audience 'wants' as they try too hard to be 'modern,' meaning the director couldn't make any creative decisions; the direction on both a macro and microscale feels very formulaic to other Rom-Coms; the direction of actors is very bad as he does not establish any chemistry for the cast as all the performances feel mundane and toneless; the storytelling is a formulaic and predictable Rom-Com), Bad Acting (Bad to Pretty Bad from Sydney Sweeney (The overall performance feels mundane and toneless and she fails to establish any chemistry with Glen Powell, but she does have some moments where she does a decent to pretty good job), Decent to Pretty Good from Glen Powell (The only positive performance in the movie as he holds his own and leads the movie well as a Rom-Com lead (it's just the material is so bad he can only do so much)), Decent from Alexandra Shipp (Actually holds her own well and shows some a little range (which is a lot given this movie)), Bad from GaTa (Cannot match the levels of any of the other actors and feels very toneless with little effort), Pretty Bad from Hadley Robinson (Just doesn't offer anything), Decent from Michelle Hurd (Shows some experience and decent timing), Decent from Dermot Mulroney (Has some charisma and timing), Decent from Charlee Fraser (The most surprising performance of the movie as she holds her own fairly well and establishes some charm and chemistry with Glen Powell), Very Bad from the rest of the cast (Just a lot of toneless and stereotypical Rom-Com performances; there is no chemistry in the entire cast)), Very Bad Story (The concept is a modern retelling of Shakespeare's 'Much Ado About Nothing,' but it does not do anything to be unique as it just follows the cookie cutter Rom-Com plot (mixed with forced modern references); the story construction is incredibly formulaic as each scene is incredibly predictable on what is going to happen and where it is going to go; because the movie is so predictable, there is a flow because it just follows this boilerplate to a tea; the character writing is terrible as all the characters as so shallow and stereotypical to Rom-Coms (and things are brought up for characters that never get addressed or add more depth to the characters)), Very Bad Screenplay (The dialogue is atrocious and very predictable (the movie forces in so many modern references that it just feels like they are pandering to the youth rather than writing realistic dialogue); the joke hit rate is probably 1 out of every 5 jokes (and some of the jokes are just so stupid that its cringe at how they even made this movie); the symbolism is incredibly overt (with the quotes from the source material and the messages of the story being overlaid onto the screen); the foreshadowing is incredibly overt that it makes the movie incredibly predictable), Decent Score; Decent Soundtrack (Did enjoy the songs they chose), Pretty Good Cinematography (Very polished as you could tell the studio put in a lot of money to make this movie), Pretty Bad Sound (Some of the sound effects are just off from what happened), Decent Editing (The actual edit was very polished and felt like it had a big budget; the cut for the movie just feels weird as it is obvious where they did reshoots and what was originally shot), Good Costumes (They made a very conscious decision with what each character was wearing to get people to watch this movie (and I respect that)), Plot Structure followed the source material's and Rom-Com template to a tee (which made the movie incredibly formulaic and predictable), Pacing was decent (as it kept the Rom-Com pace), Climax was so forced and incredibly formulaic (which made me cringe very hard when watching this movie), Tone was very similar to other Rom-Coms (especially from the early 2010s), It was so obvious where there were reshoots for this movie as some of the scenes were so bad and some were more tolerable."
"Anyone But You","masonsaul","30 December 2023",710,"Anyone But You is an enjoyably cynical rom com that still has plenty of heartfelt romance at its centre. Just getting one of these theatrically released currently is kind of a miracle and it plays squarely to the genre's strengths. All its beats are predictable in the best way.Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell are on their way to becoming genuine movie stars and this film only further solidifies that. The constant barbs they send each other's way for the majority of the film are really funny and the chemistry they're constantly trying to deny has a real spark to it.This isn't Will Gluck's first rom com and that's apparent in the good ways. The broad physical comedy is balanced nicely by the snappy wit interspersed throughout and it's surprisingly epic (a lot more helicopter stuff than expected). A good soundtrack always helps with this genre and the one here nails it."
"Anyone But You","Remmuchan","27 December 2023",310,"I cannot for the life of me understand how this ended up being a movie shown in theaters. I went into this having no idea what the movie was about. I can now say that I wish I never even bothered to purchase a ticket to see this atrocity. It was the biggest waste of my time ever.I cannot tell you how many times I cringed watching this and how many times I wanted it to just end. The acting was AWFUL, especially from the lead actress who tried so hard to act seductive but it just came off as terrible. Everything about this movie made no sense. The plot line was awful. It felt like watching a really cheesy Netflix rom-com but a hundred times worse. The shocking nude scenes just added to its awfulness.I can't get over how bad this is and I really think they just wanted to make something to tick all the boxes of what a rom-com is except it did not tick any of those boxes at all. Terrible acting, terrible movie, terrible plot line, terrible directing, terrible EVERYTHING.I HATED this movie. Avoid at all costs."
"Anyone But You","MichaelByTheSea","26 December 2023",910,"This was like an R rated raunchy Hallmark movie where people actually have sex. I can do without the miscommunication trope that drove apart a couple that seemed to be connecting, but I enjoyed the banter and really enjoyed the stars.""Serious"" critics typically don't appreciate the rom-com genre and judge them harshly. I went with my adult children and we all loved the movie. My kids make fun of my love for Hallmark movies, but even they liked this one. We laughed out loud repeatedly and walked out smiling. I love that feeling.Sure, the script is flawed, the plot's ridiculous, and some of the dialogue is a bit off, but Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney light up the screen with their amazing chemistry. They're extraordinary specimens and look like they spend 6 hours a day in the gym, but I also like them as actors. Glen Powell was really good in another enjoyable modern rom-com with Zoey Deutch called ""Set It Up"" and he's fearless here, especially with the over the top body humor.Sydney Sweeney is certainly voluptuous, and gorgeous to look at, but she's also established herself as a great actress in more critic friendly shows like ""Euphoria"" and ""White Lotus"". Edgy and dark is fine, and it certainly gets taken more seriously by the critics, but I prefer getting lost in an escapist rom-com that doesn't involve terrible people doing terrible things.I want more of this."
"Anyone But You","Iwona2403","8 February 2024",710,"Finally a romantic comedy that feels like something from late 90s, early 00's.Dig this so much!!These movies are not Oscar material nor were they intended to be. But they are heartwarming and cute!Teens should have more movies like this!Us adults, we're craving for good old style romantic comedies.I hope Hollywood will keep making more and more of these!The chemistry was very good between main characters! The colors of the movie... The vibe throughout entire movie! I enjoyed it.It's a seven from me cause I desperately need more movies like this.Thank you creators for finally making us happy! 😊"
"Anyone But You","NatKaminska","28 December 2023",110,"I need to warn those of you who want to spend your money on this thing: don't do it, not worth it. I watched the movie and it was horrible. It tried to be a charming '90s and '2000s rom-com, yet it failed in every department except with the male lead. Glen Powell is the only good thing about this movie.'Anyone but you' is full of cliches and while you can do cliches in a good way, and make genuine, great gem of a specific genre, this is not the case here. The movie is boring, shallow, cringe comedy with typical cringe, over-the-top, not-funny jokes, maybe 1 joke lands in the entire movie, that's how bad it is. The supposedly 'hilarious' nude scene on the cliff, especially the part when Powell is bending over, completely naked, holding his balls in his hands, is the next level of cringe, nothing funny, nothing charming, just cringe, awkward, awful. It's also full of heavy, not subtle, and obvious cultural references as if the writers just wrote down popular internet memes. Man, these writers really don't have any respect for the viewers. I basically wanted to walk out of this movie after the first 15 minutes.The romance part is badly done as well. The chemistry is average at best, just like a normal chemistry between two beautiful people - they are easy on the eyes oh right, like most people in this industry, but nothing more. They are not Mulder and Scully or Hanks and Ryan. Another problem with the main couple is that only Powell is to some degree likable, even tho the script doesn't make his character particularly likable, Powell's natural charisma and charm do the trick. With Sweeney that doesn't exist, she is utterly unlikeable as Bea, and this flaw kills the romance and fun completely. Despite what was said about this duo during the last summer and what some of their blind stans and the media still say now, they don't fit together as a rom-com couple at all!The screenplay itself doesn't help the actors achieve any chemistry, as the entire story is incredibly predictable, and thus boring, with awful dialogues and wooden acting most of the time.Nothing really happens in this movie! Any romantic comedy has to have some stakes in the relationship, some solid drama, and funny, unexpected twists and turns that make sense at least in the fictional universe. In this movie, the conflict that starts Ben and Bea's feud doesn't even make sense! Literally, one minute of simple explanation would clear the air between them, as they are visibly attracted to each other, from the first moment they meet. So the whole basis of this film, that they hate each other, doesn't make sense. We needed some stronger reason for the hate here.Yes, I'm aware that this movie is based on Shakespeare's play 'Much Ado About Nothing', and that one point of that play is that a great fuss/drama between the protagonists started from something insignificant ('nothing'), but every artist, and not only an artist but average person, knows that film is a completely different medium than a theater play, and what worked in a play about romance, written in Shakespeare's times, doesn't work as well in a modern, romantic comedy film. This movie isn't written intelligently enough to make it work either. Again, for the plot to be compelling in this film, we needed a stronger reason for hatred between the main characters, and the development of the characters, and we got neither of those things. Throughout the film, the characters are basic sketches, and we don't know much about them till the end.Then, during the next two, remaining acts of the movie, also nothing really happens. They decide to fake that they are together out of the blue, and their reasons for it are also simply not good enough for the audience to care about the characters and the story. Throughout the entire film, we don't see at all that Ben genuinely desires his ex, and Bea's parents don't have enough of the presence, are completely flat, insignificant characters for the audience to believe or care that she needs to lie to them, which were the two main reasons for the masquerade. Therefore, another giant flaw of the script: the motivations of the main characters that are supposed to push the plot forward are insufficient to be credible and interesting to the audience.In general, the problem is that nothing is fleshed out in 'Anyone but You' - not the main storyline, not the two main leads, not the background characters, drama, or comedy.The 'meta' lines in the script, the kinda 'wink- wink we know it's typical rom-com trope' also don't work because for this to work, the entire script would have to be much more intelligent and satirical, and it isn't smart or a satire at all! It just tried to cheat the audience by doing this, or the writers gave themselves an easy excuse for the rest of their bad writing, and again - it doesn't work. Nothing works in this movie.Yet another big problem: Sydney doesn't have a talent for comedy, sorry. Her delivery is very bland and too stiff, her character is flat, like cut out of a cardboard figure. I just don't understand how someone like her could get the role specifically in romantic comedy if she doesn't fit this role at all. Weren't there some other, better, and actually comedy-talented, cute actresses available during the casting process? Or was it just an easy money grab because it is Sydney Sweeney from 'Euphoria'?Glen is the only one who can be genuinely hilarious and gives his all, and that is not a surprise for anyone who follows his career. Glen already showed his comedy talent in Scream Queens but also proved it as Hangman in Top Gun. He is a very funny guy in real life too, as you can see in his interviews, so it's obvious comedy is natural for him. That's why he absolutely is in his element in this movie, and he 'feels it' but the problem is no one of the rest of the cast is, including Sydney. And Glen alone is still not good enough to save this movie.When you have such a difference in comedic chops between two leads in a romantic comedy that is a giant problem. I don't know if you noticed, but the hilarious thing is, you can already see in the trailers, that Sydney is not good at all in this movie. I remember that I commented her delivery is terrible the minute I watched the trailer!After I watched this movie, I definitely think Glen is much better in romantic comedies when paired with Zoey Deutch. Glen has a way better, more organic, and natural chemistry with Zoey than with Sydney, maybe because Zoey has a comedy talent just like Glen. I saw on Glen's IMDB that he is going to star in another comedy with Zoey, hopefully, better written than this one, so I will wait for it.To sum up, 'Anyone but You' is not worth one second of your time, your money, or any buzz, just wait for the the movie to appear on the streaming platforms. It doesn't have the great main couple, it doesn't have good background characters, it doesn't have the charm, wit, and natural flow that romantic comedies of the '90s or early '2000 had, like She's All That, Love Actually, Holiday, 10 Things I Hate About You, or How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.It simply doesn't have good or even decent writing! And I'm not the enemy of romantic comedies, I'm a woman and aspiring filmmaker, I love great romantic comedies just like any other great movie, of any other genre. But this movie is so bad, that I genuinely felt ashamed while watching it - I felt ashamed for the filmmakers who made this, especially the writers. Don't bother!"
"Anyone But You","SnoopyStyle","24 February 2024",610,"Bea (Sydney Sweeney) meets Ben (Glen Powell) in a coffee shop and they hook up. There are misunderstandings next morning and they leave angry. It turns out that his friend is marrying her sister. The two enemies have to attend a destination wedding in Australia.Sweeney and Powell are trying all kind of broad physical humor. They are both gorgeous and both have good charisma. Neither are outright comedians and that is important. They are mildly funny but are rarely the funniest part. The first big laugh is the WTF old guy while the two bicker. The butt grabbing scene kinda works, but the leads may be overshadowed by a koala. This duo tries very hard. It's so ridiculous that it's mildly funny."
"Anyone But You","johnnymonsarrat","3 February 2024",410,"Hello again, fellow film travelers.I have to wonder what happened to the writing of this movie. There are some interesting and touching twists to the plot. But mainly it seems plot driven, not character driven. Characters don't make consistent choices with their personality or logic, for example what happens with the parents at the end.The male lead has an acting style that's full of confidence, but he's supposed to be a comic figure that has disabling phobias. God knows why he can barely swim but he can teach diving.The female lead, I take no pleasure in saying this, tends to speak at the other actors instead of to them.I get that the writers were trying to go for a Shakespeare type of thing, like Much Ado About Nothing, but the movie simply wasn't comedic enough to have unconvincing character choices. You can get away with a lot of goofy stuff in a slapstick comedy. But this had mostly drama. So the characters need to make sense.I am sorry. I really wanted to like this.There were hints of genius. There was some good physical comedy and a few touchimg moments. But the cringe worthy flaws buried them."
"Anyone But You","gerrgrady-86307","27 December 2023",210,"My husband and I chose this movie as a Saturday treat. We left around the halfway mark because I kept hoping that it would improve - a waste of time & our weekly movie budget. The actors were given dialog that was juvenile and scene set-ups that were embarrassing. Lots of gratitious nudity and shots of partial nudity. Anyone interested in seeing this movie should just watch the trailer - it gives viewers a good picture of what they'll see at the theater so they don't waste their time sitting through a really bad movie. It was great seeing Bryan Brown but I wish he had chosen a better vehicle in which to appear than this dreck. I had greater expections for Glen Powell, but then maybe this is the level of his actual talent. Sad."
"Anyone But You","DeanAmythe","4 January 2024",410,"Never been into romcoms all that much (I watch movies alone all day as a true cinglephile), though I acknowledge their importance in filling the void for comfort watches: predictable, feel-good, and just the right amount of schmaltz - perfect for a night out (or in). Their template structure isn't so much a concern rather than an obstacle to overcome, which can be achieved with a fun gimmick of some sort, or, simply, by hitting the comedic marks. If this genre wants to see its resurgence these points are vital, and last year's NO HARD FEELINGS was eager to prove that, a return to form yet still raunchy and imbued with a surprising air of maturity - and even when the jokes didn't land, there was still enjoyment to be found in the excellent(ly cast) leads. ANYONE BUT YOU is as back-to-basics as it could get and appears to be, to a certain extent, aware of that, though here the drive to still be its own thing is completely absent. What immediately stands out is the central 'do-they, don't-they', which pretty much feeds directly into the classic plot structure and is barely taken advantage of. When it is being used for comedic purposes, it easily produces the highlights of the film, like the view/spider scene. Most of this, though, is by-the-numbers and safe, lacking any edge or remarkable features aside from the leads' sex appeal (on that front, the quality of the casting is equal to NO HARD FEELINGS). Speaking of them, Powell is as fun as expected - he would most likely be a solid movie star if the current Hollywood system allowed for those - but Sweeney? No clue what she's doing with those line reads, constantly sounding like a bad impression of an American high school girl with a ready disinterest in everything. Not that she has that much to work with anyway, as the script suffers from eye-rollers of jokes, that first half especially bursting with ""did I just say that out loud?"" humor. My sold out screening was awfully silent through most of this, though maybe they were just there for the aforementioned hotties. Just so you know: you don't get a (proper) view of Sweeney's melons, but you do get to see a squeezed Australian glans. 4/10."
"Anyone But You","jaynzsarah-561-359737","10 February 2024",110,"Launch a cannon to your head.This is one of the worst films I have ever had the misfortune to watch. I could feel my brain cells dying as I watched this absolute mess of a rom-com.Sydney Sweeney was horrible and has all but ruined her career. She could not make any part of her character believable. Very hard to watch.I'm embarrassed for Brian brown for having anything to do with this movie. He couldn't save this film from disaster.The script jumped all over the place and was so completely unrealistic... not once did the film make me believe any part of it could happen.The film relies on poor humour, And, what they don't show you in the commercials is that it's full of far-left LGBTQ propaganda.I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy."
"Anyone But You","ethanbresnett","6 January 2024",710,"Anyone But You caught me a little bit by surprise I must say. Perhaps that's because my expectations were quite low, but they really needn't have been as this film is a really solid romcom.Primarily this comes from Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney. A romcom lives and dies by its romantic leads, and they are both great in this, nailing the weird and evolving chemistry between their two characters. They are each decently well written, feeling believable and engaging.On top of this, there is a fairly forgettable but perfectly pleasant assortment of supporting characters who add some extra levels of humour to the piece.Speaking of humour, it is a bit hit and miss in this film. There aren't many big laughs, but it is amusing and does have a light and goofy tone throughout that is befitting of any romcom.Now, this film doesn't really reinvent the wheel in any way. It has all the same story beats as most romcoms and doesn't take too many risks. Therefore the plot is fairly mediocre and (as with practically all romcoms) is far too predictable. This never really gets in the way of the fun though, but the inevitable ending does make it feel a teensy bit too long.Overall though I think this is a really solid film. It has a good tone, a couple of engaging leads, and will give you a few laughs too."
"Anyone But You","tm-sheehan","5 January 2024",610,"My Review. Anyone But You
My Rating. 6:10Very very loosely based on Shakespeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"" with even a few quotations in the background and title cards this pleasant enough rom com reminds me of a line from a 16 th Century play The Merchant of Venice by same William Shakespeare, ""All that glisters is not gold"".Which of course translates in today's language ""All that glitters is not gold "".Anyone But You has a pleasant cast set in and around Sydney which is fun to spot locations like the QVB building, and our beautiful harbour vistas and pristine beaches.I was reminded of a far superior Classic romantic comedy ""My Best Friend's Wedding "" 1997 when I saw the actor playing the brides father Dermot Mulroney who achieved great success playing a similar lead 26 years ago to Glen Powell who plays Ben the romantic lead man in this movie.I enjoyed both the young leads Sydney Sweeney who plays Bea and Glen Powell who play the star crossed lovers .The differences and similarities for me in great romance comedies with weddings like My Best Friends Wedding and more recently Crazy Rich Asians is obvious they all look fabulous with surroundings that celebrate the affluence of wealthy privileged people .Where they differ from each other is in the quality of the script writing in this case by Ilana Wolpert and Will Gluck.Light comedy can be clever if it's not pretentious why try and improve on Shakespeare? It's an impossible task.Anyone But You is entertaining but parts of it I found really irritating and contrived.Adding a same sex wedding was a nice modern touch but it's the most heterosexual same sex wedding I've ever seen not one Gay in this village except Claudia and Halle the betrothed couple.The most irritating characters for me were the parents of the brides played by Dermot Mulroney, Rachel Griffiths, Bryan Brown and Michelle Hurd they all seemed to be trying to hard .I can't be to critical of this light comedy that probably appeals to a younger audience demographic than myself .I hope it succeeds overseas as we need to export more home grown cinema product from Australia but we can't just rely on great scenery and cute animal platitudes like winking koalas ."
"Anyone But You","psxexperten","9 February 2024",110,"Horrible, don't waste your time
Weak story, unnecessarily extensive vulgar language, and excessive nudity humiliates the actors. Embarrassing movie that degrades men and women and shows no imagination. It is very sad to believe that this movie appeals to people. Downright stupid with no redeeming qualities.I had respect for some of these actors before I watched this movie. All I can say is that perhaps they will do anything for money. I cannot see any other reason to have participated in this film and I am scared for any teenagers or young adults that are entertained by showing off your body and acting like adolescent fools."
"Anyone But You","movieman6-413-929510","5 January 2024",510,"Anyone But You is a new romantic comedy directed, written and produced in part by Will Gluck, director of Easy A and Friends with Benefits.Bea (Sydney Sweeney) and Ben (Glen Powell) haven't seen each other since a first date. When they are both invited to the same wedding, the two meet again.They learn that people are trying to hook them up so they don't cause further problems during the wedding. This is why they pretend, to get rid of the fuss.Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell have good chemistry together in the film and both know how to play well and playfully with and against each other. Despite their chemistry, the overall film is unfortunately more on the standard side of a romantic comedy. This gives the film game its well-known and predictable sides. Other moments come across as a bit too forced. For co-writer Ilana Wolpert, this is only her first written film story.Another downside of the film is the amount of extra characters. Many of these extras bring their own kind of comedy, but otherwise have little real use in the film. With a few fewer of these extras, the film could have been better focused, with a shorter running time."

Maybe will distract people from her weird acting and that strange way of talking like she has something lodged on her cheeks.Dont waste your money or time in this , go do laundry or try to make that recipe you saved from tik tok.There is a reason they were trying so hard with the promo, EVERYBODY KNEW IT WAS A FLOP."
"Anyone But You","alyetc","28 December 2023",510,"We've seen a million movies set at weddings before - where even the couple getting married gets invested in the main couples status. So I knew a lot of the tropes would be the same, but it was the same but a bit worse. The main couple story I actually really liked, I thought they were hilarious and cute and beat out other movies with the same storyline. It was everything else that fell short. The background characters felt cheesy and fake. All surface level gags or you didn't really get to know them, nothing felt genuine - case in point Bea's parents were incredibly unrealistic, no ones that out of touch. Even Bea's background felt half-done, never explaining why she didn't want law school."

Its repetitive and cliché romantic comedy storyline lacked originality, leaving the audience unengaged. The attempts at humor fell flat, resulting in a tedious and cringe-worthy viewing experience. To add to the disappointment, the lead actress's annoying voice only added to the overall lackluster quality of the film, making it a forgettable and uninspiring cinematic endeavor. Terrible acting and story. I don't understand the high rating of this movie, or the hype. Save your time and skip this one. The movie is downright horrible, with uncomfortable scenes that make you question their choices. Shame on them for delivering such a poorly written script, leading to an overall disappointing and regrettable cinematic experience."
"Anyone But You","barbett-1","1 January 2024",510,"Neither brilliant nor dreadful, ""Anyone But You"" features a cast of characters that are unbelievably attractive and, apparently, insanely wealthy. It stars Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeny's breasts in the formulatic equivalent of a Hallmark Movie knock-off. You know the drill - two perfect young people meet, are instantly attracted to each other, are separated by a misunderstanding with hilarious hijinks ensuing. The misunderstanding is eventually resolved, love blooms once more, and all ends well.What sets this film apart is excellent cinematography with lovely wide-angle views of the Australian countryside. The supporting cast is very capable although the Australian men are played as oafish stereotypes. Glen Powell plays his part well, but Sydney Sweeny appears to be reading her lines from a teleprompter offscreen. Not the worst movie out this holiday season and enjoyable as long as you refrain from high expectations."
"Anyone But You","pkertes-59666","5 January 2024",410,"I went to see this movie because I am a sucker for a romantic comedy, even the average ones (and let's face it, most of them are). Having seen the trailer, I had low expectations, yet this film still managed to come it at an even lower level.Boy meets girl, they hit it off briefly, there is a misunderstanding and when they reconnect through a friend/family wedding, they hate each other. Except as anyone could predict, ultimately they don't really, but it takes an eternity of inauthentic, puerile dross to get there. No tissues needed here.The acting is generally average to poor, and local actors like Rachel Griffiths and Bryan Brown (much of it filmed in Australia) do the minimum required, and are completely wasted here. The script is juvenile, facile and has little in common with reality. The direction is pedestrian and much of the movie is a travel ad for Sydney. Throw in plastic, unlikeable characters and a healthy dose of gratuitous nudity. The attempts at comedy are almost laughable as that, and what little romance eventuates at the end fails to convince after nearly two hours of tripe beforehand.Not recommended, even if you are a fan of the genre."
"Anyone But You","trinaboice","8 January 2024",410,"IN A NUTSHELL:
After an amazing first date, Bea and Ben's fiery attraction turns ice-cold until they find themselves unexpectedly reunited at a destination wedding in Australia that their exes also attend. So, they do what any two mature adults would do: pretend to be a couple amidst the fighting.The film was directed by Will Gluck, who also wrote it with Ilana Wolpert.Ultimately, this is like a rated R Hallmark movie with lots of raunch.THINGS I LIKED:
There is plenty of eye candy here for everyone. The cast is filled with good-looking people and includes Sydney Sweeney, Glen Powell, Alexandra Shipp, Hadley Robinson, GaTa, Michelle Hurd, Dermot Mulroney, Rachel Griffiths, Bryan Brown, and more.Sydney Sweeney was bit by a spider in the movie while filming. That famous clip was posted online and got a lot of stir.We get to visit Australia during the film.The cast is diverse, offering a variety of stories about romance and love.The last scene takes clips from the whole movie and has all of the actors sing the same song for a feel-good moment.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Sure, everyone in the cast is hot, but the script is garbage. It sounded like it was written by a trashy version of Chat GPT.It's supposed to be funny, but it's pathetic how they are instantly super ugly and mean-spirited to each other when they have a miscommunication.It's SUPER predictable.Cliched end-of-movie singing, dancing scene.So much fighting.So many awkward moments.They say the movie is loosely based on Shakepeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"", but I think the Bard would be disgusted by the lack of intelligent language in the script. So many F-bombs. One similarity is that they get a wedding cake from a shop called ""Dogberry's"", which is the name of a character in the play.I cringed and rolled my eyes so many times.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
This movie is definitely not appropriate for kids. It portrays unhealthy relationships and extremely bad behavior.Kids will be completely bored because it's mostly adults talking to each other.Profanity and lots of F-bombs
A lesbian couple kisses and gets married
We see a topless woman
We see several shirtless men
A couple gropes each other inside their shorts.Two women wear bikini tops that barely cover anything.We see a ton of cleavage
A lot of sexual innuendo. We see an unmarried couple in the shower and bed together.We see two men smoke a joint.!"
"Anyone But You","ambusched94","31 December 2023",210,"A forgettable, expendable rom-com where all the somewhat funny, shock value scenes are exposed in the theatrical trailer and there is hardly any laugh-out-loud scenes in this film overall.While Glen Powell has the comedy chops and romantic charm for this film genre, to my astonishment it's the EXACT OPPOSITE for Sydney Sweeney. Her line delivery is dull and she has the same facial expressions, blank stare, dead eyes for most scenes in Anyone But You. You can tell she's acting as in she's not embodying the character in the story and she's simply reading the lines, not conveying any natural nuances in her character each time she does this. Sweeney's crying scene in the taxi felt unnaturally forced. I was surprised her acting was half-a**ed, whereas in the TV series Euphoria (2019-present) her acting feels natural. Or highly likely that she's a limited-range, one-note actress that can only do dark, coming-of-age drama genre and fails at rom-com. IMO, Powell and Sweeney had the most chemistry when their characters were arguing and hating each other. When they got all lovey dovey, the on-screen chemistry felt forced and it was lacking that romantic spark between their characters. I was not invested enough in their progressing relationship to care once they officially got together in the end.So one, I feel like Sweeney largely ruins the film with her bland acting and line delivery, and lack of emotiveness. A better choice for the lead actress in this film should've been a comedic actress or an actress who can deftly juggle comedic timing and dramatic, emotional scenes. If this film was made and released in the 2000s decade for example, Amanda Bynes would be a prime choice for the role of Bea. And two, the character development is lacking and backstory are just tacked-on but don't add any characterization substance. The screenplay pushes the two characters to meet instantaneously at the start of the film, so viewers don't get any individual scenes of each lead character beforehand leaving a lot of character backstory nonexistent. The screenplay gives a brief overlay of each of Ben's and Bea's backstory in a scene montage and it's the error of telling over showing, and it doesn't work, leaving a rushed characterization of both characters that cheapens the film.Supporting characters feel like caricatures and don't add anything to the story. No supporting character was memorable. Some corny dialogue and meta rom-com instances that seem shoehorned in. Also, I wish Darren Barnet (Paxton from the TV series Never Have I Ever (2020-2023)) had more scenes, dialogue and that he would've been the guy Bea ended up with if there was an unexpected surprise, twist ending, instead of the ""enemies to lovers"" and ""stuck together so they'll end up together"" overused romance tropes. But the screenplay is too safe and screenwriters would never be bold enough to rise up to a different, atypical ending like this.I did like that the majority of the film was set in Australia and a few of the songs used in the film's soundtrack.It's ironic that Dermot Mulroney and Rachel Griffiths are in this sucky rom-com when blasting back to the past to 1997, both Mulroney (as the leading man and love interest) and Griffiths (in a supporting role) starred in a first rate quality rom-com, My Best Friend's Wedding. This is why most of my fave rom-coms are from the '90s and the 2000s. When quality storytelling, chemistry, and character development reigned in comparison to this current rom-com garbage.Anyone But You is a derivative, formulaic rom-com that's ultimately unmemorable, vapid rom-com plot, and a waste of time. Just casually watch it once it comes out on streaming if you have nothing else to watch and don't care about draining 1 hour 43 minutes of your time."
"Anyone But You","dogonlion","10 February 2024",110,"Everything in this movie feels forced. The comedy is like ""please laugh, please laugh"". I guess that works on some. Nothing flows naturally. The way they love at first sight and all of the sudden start bickering is unrealistic. The bickering is annoying. Sydney Sweeney is a really good actress, I really liked her in The White Lotus, but she's hasn't been in a movie that uses her full potential yet. The movie is full of cliches. It even has the funny black friend with no love life. I'm really shocked by how much money this movie made. I guess as long as those kinds of movies make money they'll keep the same formula and keep factory produce them and soon will use artificial intelligence to write them."

It had some cute scenes. I gotta say the ensemble was pretty good if I laughed it was always because something one of them said. They were a bunch of goofy characters. I also enjoyed dermot mulroney's character when he was learning how to dive and the reoccurance of that at the end of the movie. It made me giggle.But I gotta say... the dialogue was very mediocre and at times just not good at all. It just lacked depth which again didn't expect it to have depth but still could have been better."

Overall, an incredibly formulaic Rom-Com that tries way too hard to capitalize on the popularity and looks of Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney, but fails hard as it is so predictable and barely funny.Bad Direction (The whole movie just feels like the studio shelled out something to tick boxes rather than make a well thought-out comedy (this included plot concepts, wardrobing, and jokes) because that's what they think the audience 'wants' as they try too hard to be 'modern,' meaning the director couldn't make any creative decisions; the direction on both a macro and microscale feels very formulaic to other Rom-Coms; the direction of actors is very bad as he does not establish any chemistry for the cast as all the performances feel mundane and toneless; the storytelling is a formulaic and predictable Rom-Com), Bad Acting (Bad to Pretty Bad from Sydney Sweeney (The overall performance feels mundane and toneless and she fails to establish any chemistry with Glen Powell, but she does have some moments where she does a decent to pretty good job), Decent to Pretty Good from Glen Powell (The only positive performance in the movie as he holds his own and leads the movie well as a Rom-Com lead (it's just the material is so bad he can only do so much)), Decent from Alexandra Shipp (Actually holds her own well and shows some a little range (which is a lot given this movie)), Bad from GaTa (Cannot match the levels of any of the other actors and feels very toneless with little effort), Pretty Bad from Hadley Robinson (Just doesn't offer anything), Decent from Michelle Hurd (Shows some experience and decent timing), Decent from Dermot Mulroney (Has some charisma and timing), Decent from Charlee Fraser (The most surprising performance of the movie as she holds her own fairly well and establishes some charm and chemistry with Glen Powell), Very Bad from the rest of the cast (Just a lot of toneless and stereotypical Rom-Com performances; there is no chemistry in the entire cast)), Very Bad Story (The concept is a modern retelling of Shakespeare's 'Much Ado About Nothing,' but it does not do anything to be unique as it just follows the cookie cutter Rom-Com plot (mixed with forced modern references); the story construction is incredibly formulaic as each scene is incredibly predictable on what is going to happen and where it is going to go; because the movie is so predictable, there is a flow because it just follows this boilerplate to a tea; the character writing is terrible as all the characters as so shallow and stereotypical to Rom-Coms (and things are brought up for characters that never get addressed or add more depth to the characters)), Very Bad Screenplay (The dialogue is atrocious and very predictable (the movie forces in so many modern references that it just feels like they are pandering to the youth rather than writing realistic dialogue); the joke hit rate is probably 1 out of every 5 jokes (and some of the jokes are just so stupid that its cringe at how they even made this movie); the symbolism is incredibly overt (with the quotes from the source material and the messages of the story being overlaid onto the screen); the foreshadowing is incredibly overt that it makes the movie incredibly predictable), Decent Score; Decent Soundtrack (Did enjoy the songs they chose), Pretty Good Cinematography (Very polished as you could tell the studio put in a lot of money to make this movie), Pretty Bad Sound (Some of the sound effects are just off from what happened), Decent Editing (The actual edit was very polished and felt like it had a big budget; the cut for the movie just feels weird as it is obvious where they did reshoots and what was originally shot), Good Costumes (They made a very conscious decision with what each character was wearing to get people to watch this movie (and I respect that)), Plot Structure followed the source material's and Rom-Com template to a tee (which made the movie incredibly formulaic and predictable), Pacing was decent (as it kept the Rom-Com pace), Climax was so forced and incredibly formulaic (which made me cringe very hard when watching this movie), Tone was very similar to other Rom-Coms (especially from the early 2010s), It was so obvious where there were reshoots for this movie as some of the scenes were so bad and some were more tolerable."
"Anyone But You","masonsaul","30 December 2023",710,"Anyone But You is an enjoyably cynical rom com that still has plenty of heartfelt romance at its centre. Just getting one of these theatrically released currently is kind of a miracle and it plays squarely to the genre's strengths. All its beats are predictable in the best way.Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell are on their way to becoming genuine movie stars and this film only further solidifies that. The constant barbs they send each other's way for the majority of the film are really funny and the chemistry they're constantly trying to deny has a real spark to it.This isn't Will Gluck's first rom com and that's apparent in the good ways. The broad physical comedy is balanced nicely by the snappy wit interspersed throughout and it's surprisingly epic (a lot more helicopter stuff than expected). A good soundtrack always helps with this genre and the one here nails it."
"Anyone But You","Remmuchan","27 December 2023",310,"I cannot for the life of me understand how this ended up being a movie shown in theaters. I went into this having no idea what the movie was about. I can now say that I wish I never even bothered to purchase a ticket to see this atrocity. It was the biggest waste of my time ever.I cannot tell you how many times I cringed watching this and how many times I wanted it to just end. The acting was AWFUL, especially from the lead actress who tried so hard to act seductive but it just came off as terrible. Everything about this movie made no sense. The plot line was awful. It felt like watching a really cheesy Netflix rom-com but a hundred times worse. The shocking nude scenes just added to its awfulness.I can't get over how bad this is and I really think they just wanted to make something to tick all the boxes of what a rom-com is except it did not tick any of those boxes at all. Terrible acting, terrible movie, terrible plot line, terrible directing, terrible EVERYTHING.I HATED this movie. Avoid at all costs."
"Anyone But You","MichaelByTheSea","26 December 2023",910,"This was like an R rated raunchy Hallmark movie where people actually have sex. I can do without the miscommunication trope that drove apart a couple that seemed to be connecting, but I enjoyed the banter and really enjoyed the stars.""Serious"" critics typically don't appreciate the rom-com genre and judge them harshly. I went with my adult children and we all loved the movie. My kids make fun of my love for Hallmark movies, but even they liked this one. We laughed out loud repeatedly and walked out smiling. I love that feeling.Sure, the script is flawed, the plot's ridiculous, and some of the dialogue is a bit off, but Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney light up the screen with their amazing chemistry. They're extraordinary specimens and look like they spend 6 hours a day in the gym, but I also like them as actors. Glen Powell was really good in another enjoyable modern rom-com with Zoey Deutch called ""Set It Up"" and he's fearless here, especially with the over the top body humor.Sydney Sweeney is certainly voluptuous, and gorgeous to look at, but she's also established herself as a great actress in more critic friendly shows like ""Euphoria"" and ""White Lotus"". Edgy and dark is fine, and it certainly gets taken more seriously by the critics, but I prefer getting lost in an escapist rom-com that doesn't involve terrible people doing terrible things.I want more of this."

"Anyone But You","NatKaminska","28 December 2023",110,"I need to warn those of you who want to spend your money on this thing: don't do it, not worth it. I watched the movie and it was horrible. It tried to be a charming '90s and '2000s rom-com, yet it failed in every department except with the male lead. Glen Powell is the only good thing about this movie.'Anyone but you' is full of cliches and while you can do cliches in a good way, and make genuine, great gem of a specific genre, this is not the case here. The movie is boring, shallow, cringe comedy with typical cringe, over-the-top, not-funny jokes, maybe 1 joke lands in the entire movie, that's how bad it is. The supposedly 'hilarious' nude scene on the cliff, especially the part when Powell is bending over, completely naked, holding his balls in his hands, is the next level of cringe, nothing funny, nothing charming, just cringe, awkward, awful. It's also full of heavy, not subtle, and obvious cultural references as if the writers just wrote down popular internet memes. Man, these writers really don't have any respect for the viewers. I basically wanted to walk out of this movie after the first 15 minutes.The romance part is badly done as well. The chemistry is average at best, just like a normal chemistry between two beautiful people - they are easy on the eyes oh right, like most people in this industry, but nothing more. They are not Mulder and Scully or Hanks and Ryan. Another problem with the main couple is that only Powell is to some degree likable, even tho the script doesn't make his character particularly likable, Powell's natural charisma and charm do the trick. With Sweeney that doesn't exist, she is utterly unlikeable as Bea, and this flaw kills the romance and fun completely. Despite what was said about this duo during the last summer and what some of their blind stans and the media still say now, they don't fit together as a rom-com couple at all!The screenplay itself doesn't help the actors achieve any chemistry, as the entire story is incredibly predictable, and thus boring, with awful dialogues and wooden acting most of the time.Nothing really happens in this movie! Any romantic comedy has to have some stakes in the relationship, some solid drama, and funny, unexpected twists and turns that make sense at least in the fictional universe. In this movie, the conflict that starts Ben and Bea's feud doesn't even make sense! Literally, one minute of simple explanation would clear the air between them, as they are visibly attracted to each other, from the first moment they meet. So the whole basis of this film, that they hate each other, doesn't make sense. We needed some stronger reason for the hate here.Yes, I'm aware that this movie is based on Shakespeare's play 'Much Ado About Nothing', and that one point of that play is that a great fuss/drama between the protagonists started from something insignificant ('nothing'), but every artist, and not only an artist but average person, knows that film is a completely different medium than a theater play, and what worked in a play about romance, written in Shakespeare's times, doesn't work as well in a modern, romantic comedy film. This movie isn't written intelligently enough to make it work either. Again, for the plot to be compelling in this film, we needed a stronger reason for hatred between the main characters, and the development of the characters, and we got neither of those things. Throughout the film, the characters are basic sketches, and we don't know much about them till the end.Then, during the next two, remaining acts of the movie, also nothing really happens. They decide to fake that they are together out of the blue, and their reasons for it are also simply not good enough for the audience to care about the characters and the story. Throughout the entire film, we don't see at all that Ben genuinely desires his ex, and Bea's parents don't have enough of the presence, are completely flat, insignificant characters for the audience to believe or care that she needs to lie to them, which were the two main reasons for the masquerade. Therefore, another giant flaw of the script: the motivations of the main characters that are supposed to push the plot forward are insufficient to be credible and interesting to the audience.In general, the problem is that nothing is fleshed out in 'Anyone but You' - not the main storyline, not the two main leads, not the background characters, drama, or comedy.The 'meta' lines in the script, the kinda 'wink- wink we know it's typical rom-com trope' also don't work because for this to work, the entire script would have to be much more intelligent and satirical, and it isn't smart or a satire at all! It just tried to cheat the audience by doing this, or the writers gave themselves an easy excuse for the rest of their bad writing, and again - it doesn't work. Nothing works in this movie.Yet another big problem: Sydney doesn't have a talent for comedy, sorry. Her delivery is very bland and too stiff, her character is flat, like cut out of a cardboard figure. I just don't understand how someone like her could get the role specifically in romantic comedy if she doesn't fit this role at all. Weren't there some other, better, and actually comedy-talented, cute actresses available during the casting process? Or was it just an easy money grab because it is Sydney Sweeney from 'Euphoria'?Glen is the only one who can be genuinely hilarious and gives his all, and that is not a surprise for anyone who follows his career. Glen already showed his comedy talent in Scream Queens but also proved it as Hangman in Top Gun. He is a very funny guy in real life too, as you can see in his interviews, so it's obvious comedy is natural for him. That's why he absolutely is in his element in this movie, and he 'feels it' but the problem is no one of the rest of the cast is, including Sydney. And Glen alone is still not good enough to save this movie.When you have such a difference in comedic chops between two leads in a romantic comedy that is a giant problem. I don't know if you noticed, but the hilarious thing is, you can already see in the trailers, that Sydney is not good at all in this movie. I remember that I commented her delivery is terrible the minute I watched the trailer!After I watched this movie, I definitely think Glen is much better in romantic comedies when paired with Zoey Deutch. Glen has a way better, more organic, and natural chemistry with Zoey than with Sydney, maybe because Zoey has a comedy talent just like Glen. I saw on Glen's IMDB that he is going to star in another comedy with Zoey, hopefully, better written than this one, so I will wait for it.To sum up, 'Anyone but You' is not worth one second of your time, your money, or any buzz, just wait for the the movie to appear on the streaming platforms. It doesn't have the great main couple, it doesn't have good background characters, it doesn't have the charm, wit, and natural flow that romantic comedies of the '90s or early '2000 had, like She's All That, Love Actually, Holiday, 10 Things I Hate About You, or How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.It simply doesn't have good or even decent writing! And I'm not the enemy of romantic comedies, I'm a woman and aspiring filmmaker, I love great romantic comedies just like any other great movie, of any other genre. But this movie is so bad, that I genuinely felt ashamed while watching it - I felt ashamed for the filmmakers who made this, especially the writers. Don't bother!"
"Anyone But You","SnoopyStyle","24 February 2024",610,"Bea (Sydney Sweeney) meets Ben (Glen Powell) in a coffee shop and they hook up. There are misunderstandings next morning and they leave angry. It turns out that his friend is marrying her sister. The two enemies have to attend a destination wedding in Australia.Sweeney and Powell are trying all kind of broad physical humor. They are both gorgeous and both have good charisma. Neither are outright comedians and that is important. They are mildly funny but are rarely the funniest part. The first big laugh is the WTF old guy while the two bicker. The butt grabbing scene kinda works, but the leads may be overshadowed by a koala. This duo tries very hard. It's so ridiculous that it's mildly funny."
"Anyone But You","johnnymonsarrat","3 February 2024",410,"Hello again, fellow film travelers.I have to wonder what happened to the writing of this movie. There are some interesting and touching twists to the plot. But mainly it seems plot driven, not character driven. Characters don't make consistent choices with their personality or logic, for example what happens with the parents at the end.The male lead has an acting style that's full of confidence, but he's supposed to be a comic figure that has disabling phobias. God knows why he can barely swim but he can teach diving.The female lead, I take no pleasure in saying this, tends to speak at the other actors instead of to them.I get that the writers were trying to go for a Shakespeare type of thing, like Much Ado About Nothing, but the movie simply wasn't comedic enough to have unconvincing character choices. You can get away with a lot of goofy stuff in a slapstick comedy. But this had mostly drama. So the characters need to make sense.I am sorry. I really wanted to like this.There were hints of genius. There was some good physical comedy and a few touchimg moments. But the cringe worthy flaws buried them."

We left around the halfway mark because I kept hoping that it would improve - a waste of time & our weekly movie budget. The actors were given dialog that was juvenile and scene set-ups that were embarrassing. Lots of gratitious nudity and shots of partial nudity. Anyone interested in seeing this movie should just watch the trailer - it gives viewers a good picture of what they'll see at the theater so they don't waste their time sitting through a really bad movie. It was great seeing Bryan Brown but I wish he had chosen a better vehicle in which to appear than this dreck. I had greater expections for Glen Powell, but then maybe this is the level of his actual talent. Sad."
"Anyone But You","DeanAmythe","4 January 2024",410,"Never been into romcoms all that much (I watch movies alone all day as a true cinglephile), though I acknowledge their importance in filling the void for comfort watches: predictable, feel-good, and just the right amount of schmaltz - perfect for a night out (or in). Their template structure isn't so much a concern rather than an obstacle to overcome, which can be achieved with a fun gimmick of some sort, or, simply, by hitting the comedic marks. If this genre wants to see its resurgence these points are vital, and last year's NO HARD FEELINGS was eager to prove that, a return to form yet still raunchy and imbued with a surprising air of maturity - and even when the jokes didn't land, there was still enjoyment to be found in the excellent(ly cast) leads. ANYONE BUT YOU is as back-to-basics as it could get and appears to be, to a certain extent, aware of that, though here the drive to still be its own thing is completely absent. What immediately stands out is the central 'do-they, don't-they', which pretty much feeds directly into the classic plot structure and is barely taken advantage of. When it is being used for comedic purposes, it easily produces the highlights of the film, like the view/spider scene. Most of this, though, is by-the-numbers and safe, lacking any edge or remarkable features aside from the leads' sex appeal (on that front, the quality of the casting is equal to NO HARD FEELINGS). Speaking of them, Powell is as fun as expected - he would most likely be a solid movie star if the current Hollywood system allowed for those - but Sweeney? No clue what she's doing with those line reads, constantly sounding like a bad impression of an American high school girl with a ready disinterest in everything. Not that she has that much to work with anyway, as the script suffers from eye-rollers of jokes, that first half especially bursting with ""did I just say that out loud?"" humor. My sold out screening was awfully silent through most of this, though maybe they were just there for the aforementioned hotties. Just so you know: you don't get a (proper) view of Sweeney's melons, but you do get to see a squeezed Australian glans. 4/10."

Very hard to watch.I'm embarrassed for Brian brown for having anything to do with this movie. He couldn't save this film from disaster.The script jumped all over the place and was so completely unrealistic... not once did the film make me believe any part of it could happen.The film relies on poor humour, And, what they don't show you in the commercials is that it's full of far-left LGBTQ propaganda.I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy."
"Anyone But You","ethanbresnett","6 January 2024",710,"Anyone But You caught me a little bit by surprise I must say. Perhaps that's because my expectations were quite low, but they really needn't have been as this film is a really solid romcom.Primarily this comes from Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney. A romcom lives and dies by its romantic leads, and they are both great in this, nailing the weird and evolving chemistry between their two characters. They are each decently well written, feeling believable and engaging.On top of this, there is a fairly forgettable but perfectly pleasant assortment of supporting characters who add some extra levels of humour to the piece.Speaking of humour, it is a bit hit and miss in this film. There aren't many big laughs, but it is amusing and does have a light and goofy tone throughout that is befitting of any romcom.Now, this film doesn't really reinvent the wheel in any way. It has all the same story beats as most romcoms and doesn't take too many risks. Therefore the plot is fairly mediocre and (as with practically all romcoms) is far too predictable. This never really gets in the way of the fun though, but the inevitable ending does make it feel a teensy bit too long.Overall though I think this is a really solid film. It has a good tone, a couple of engaging leads, and will give you a few laughs too."
"Anyone But You","tm-sheehan","5 January 2024",610,"My Review. Anyone But You
My Rating. 6:10Very very loosely based on Shakespeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"" with even a few quotations in the background and title cards this pleasant enough rom com reminds me of a line from a 16 th Century play The Merchant of Venice by same William Shakespeare, ""All that glisters is not gold"".Which of course translates in today's language ""All that glitters is not gold "".Anyone But You has a pleasant cast set in and around Sydney which is fun to spot locations like the QVB building, and our beautiful harbour vistas and pristine beaches.I was reminded of a far superior Classic romantic comedy ""My Best Friend's Wedding "" 1997 when I saw the actor playing the brides father Dermot Mulroney who achieved great success playing a similar lead 26 years ago to Glen Powell who plays Ben the romantic lead man in this movie.I enjoyed both the young leads Sydney Sweeney who plays Bea and Glen Powell who play the star crossed lovers .The differences and similarities for me in great romance comedies with weddings like My Best Friends Wedding and more recently Crazy Rich Asians is obvious they all look fabulous with surroundings that celebrate the affluence of wealthy privileged people .Where they differ from each other is in the quality of the script writing in this case by Ilana Wolpert and Will Gluck.Light comedy can be clever if it's not pretentious why try and improve on Shakespeare? It's an impossible task.Anyone But You is entertaining but parts of it I found really irritating and contrived.Adding a same sex wedding was a nice modern touch but it's the most heterosexual same sex wedding I've ever seen not one Gay in this village except Claudia and Halle the betrothed couple.The most irritating characters for me were the parents of the brides played by Dermot Mulroney, Rachel Griffiths, Bryan Brown and Michelle Hurd they all seemed to be trying to hard .I can't be to critical of this light comedy that probably appeals to a younger audience demographic than myself .I hope it succeeds overseas as we need to export more home grown cinema product from Australia but we can't just rely on great scenery and cute animal platitudes like winking koalas ."

Weak story, unnecessarily extensive vulgar language, and excessive nudity humiliates the actors. Embarrassing movie that degrades men and women and shows no imagination.

All I can say is that perhaps they will do anything for money.

"Anyone But You","movieman6-413-929510","5 January 2024",510,"Anyone But You is a new romantic comedy directed, written and produced in part by Will Gluck, director of Easy A and Friends with Benefits.Bea (Sydney Sweeney) and Ben (Glen Powell) haven't seen each other since a first date. When they are both invited to the same wedding, the two meet again.They learn that people are trying to hook them up so they don't cause further problems during the wedding. This is why they pretend, to get rid of the fuss.Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell have good chemistry together in the film and both know how to play well and playfully with and against each other. Despite their chemistry, the overall film is unfortunately more on the standard side of a romantic comedy. This gives the film game its well-known and predictable sides. Other moments come across as a bit too forced. For co-writer Ilana Wolpert, this is only her first written film story.Another downside of the film is the amount of extra characters. Many of these extras bring their own kind of comedy, but otherwise have little real use in the film. With a few fewer of these extras, the film could have been better focused, with a shorter running time."

So I knew a lot of the tropes would be the same, but it was the same but a bit worse. The main couple story I actually really liked, I thought they were hilarious and cute and beat out other movies with the same storyline. It was everything else that fell short. The background characters felt cheesy and fake. All surface level gags or you didn't really get to know them, nothing felt genuine - case in point Bea's parents were incredibly unrealistic, no ones that out of touch. Even Bea's background felt half-done, never explaining why she didn't want law school."
"Anyone But You","STARONTHETOPOFTHESKY","11 February 2024",110,"The movie, unfortunately, failed to deliver on multiple fronts. Its repetitive and cliché romantic comedy storyline lacked originality, leaving the audience unengaged. The attempts at humor fell flat, resulting in a tedious and cringe-worthy viewing experience. To add to the disappointment, the lead actress's annoying voice only added to the overall lackluster quality of the film, making it a forgettable and uninspiring cinematic endeavor. Terrible acting and story. I don't understand the high rating of this movie, or the hype. Save your time and skip this one. The movie is downright horrible, with uncomfortable scenes that make you question their choices. Shame on them for delivering such a poorly written script, leading to an overall disappointing and regrettable cinematic experience."
"Anyone But You","barbett-1","1 January 2024",510,"Neither brilliant nor dreadful, ""Anyone But You"" features a cast of characters that are unbelievably attractive and, apparently, insanely wealthy. It stars Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeny's breasts in the formulatic equivalent of a Hallmark Movie knock-off. You know the drill - two perfect young people meet, are instantly attracted to each other, are separated by a misunderstanding with hilarious hijinks ensuing. The misunderstanding is eventually resolved, love blooms once more, and all ends well.What sets this film apart is excellent cinematography with lovely wide-angle views of the Australian countryside. The supporting cast is very capable although the Australian men are played as oafish stereotypes. Glen Powell plays his part well, but Sydney Sweeny appears to be reading her lines from a teleprompter offscreen. Not the worst movie out this holiday season and enjoyable as long as you refrain from high expectations."
"Anyone But You","pkertes-59666","5 January 2024",410,"I went to see this movie because I am a sucker for a romantic comedy, even the average ones (and let's face it, most of them are). Having seen the trailer, I had low expectations, yet this film still managed to come it at an even lower level.Boy meets girl, they hit it off briefly, there is a misunderstanding and when they reconnect through a friend/family wedding, they hate each other. Except as anyone could predict, ultimately they don't really, but it takes an eternity of inauthentic, puerile dross to get there. No tissues needed here.The acting is generally average to poor, and local actors like Rachel Griffiths and Bryan Brown (much of it filmed in Australia) do the minimum required, and are completely wasted here. The script is juvenile, facile and has little in common with reality. The direction is pedestrian and much of the movie is a travel ad for Sydney. Throw in plastic, unlikeable characters and a healthy dose of gratuitous nudity. The attempts at comedy are almost laughable as that, and what little romance eventuates at the end fails to convince after nearly two hours of tripe beforehand.Not recommended, even if you are a fan of the genre."
"Anyone But You","trinaboice","8 January 2024",410,"IN A NUTSHELL:
After an amazing first date, Bea and Ben's fiery attraction turns ice-cold until they find themselves unexpectedly reunited at a destination wedding in Australia that their exes also attend. So, they do what any two mature adults would do: pretend to be a couple amidst the fighting.The film was directed by Will Gluck, who also wrote it with Ilana Wolpert.Ultimately, this is like a rated R Hallmark movie with lots of raunch.THINGS I LIKED:
There is plenty of eye candy here for everyone. The cast is filled with good-looking people and includes Sydney Sweeney, Glen Powell, Alexandra Shipp, Hadley Robinson, GaTa, Michelle Hurd, Dermot Mulroney, Rachel Griffiths, Bryan Brown, and more.Sydney Sweeney was bit by a spider in the movie while filming. That famous clip was posted online and got a lot of stir.We get to visit Australia during the film.The cast is diverse, offering a variety of stories about romance and love.The last scene takes clips from the whole movie and has all of the actors sing the same song for a feel-good moment.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Sure, everyone in the cast is hot, but the script is garbage. It sounded like it was written by a trashy version of Chat GPT.It's supposed to be funny, but it's pathetic how they are instantly super ugly and mean-spirited to each other when they have a miscommunication.It's SUPER predictable.Cliched end-of-movie singing, dancing scene.So much fighting.So many awkward moments.They say the movie is loosely based on Shakepeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"", but I think the Bard would be disgusted by the lack of intelligent language in the script. So many F-bombs. One similarity is that they get a wedding cake from a shop called ""Dogberry's"", which is the name of a character in the play.I cringed and rolled my eyes so many times.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
This movie is definitely not appropriate for kids. It portrays unhealthy relationships and extremely bad behavior.Kids will be completely bored because it's mostly adults talking to each other.Profanity and lots of F-bombs
A lesbian couple kisses and gets married
We see a topless woman
We see several shirtless men
A couple gropes each other inside their shorts.Two women wear bikini tops that barely cover anything.We see a ton of cleavage
A lot of sexual innuendo. We see an unmarried couple in the shower and bed together.We see two men smoke a joint.!"
"Anyone But You","ambusched94","31 December 2023",210,"A forgettable, expendable rom-com where all the somewhat funny, shock value scenes are exposed in the theatrical trailer and there is hardly any laugh-out-loud scenes in this film overall.While Glen Powell has the comedy chops and romantic charm for this film genre, to my astonishment it's the EXACT OPPOSITE for Sydney Sweeney. Her line delivery is dull and she has the same facial expressions, blank stare, dead eyes for most scenes in Anyone But You. You can tell she's acting as in she's not embodying the character in the story and she's simply reading the lines, not conveying any natural nuances in her character each time she does this. Sweeney's crying scene in the taxi felt unnaturally forced. I was surprised her acting was half-a**ed, whereas in the TV series Euphoria (2019-present) her acting feels natural. Or highly likely that she's a limited-range, one-note actress that can only do dark, coming-of-age drama genre and fails at rom-com. IMO, Powell and Sweeney had the most chemistry when their characters were arguing and hating each other. When they got all lovey dovey, the on-screen chemistry felt forced and it was lacking that romantic spark between their characters. I was not invested enough in their progressing relationship to care once they officially got together in the end.So one, I feel like Sweeney largely ruins the film with her bland acting and line delivery, and lack of emotiveness. A better choice for the lead actress in this film should've been a comedic actress or an actress who can deftly juggle comedic timing and dramatic, emotional scenes. If this film was made and released in the 2000s decade for example, Amanda Bynes would be a prime choice for the role of Bea. And two, the character development is lacking and backstory are just tacked-on but don't add any characterization substance. The screenplay pushes the two characters to meet instantaneously at the start of the film, so viewers don't get any individual scenes of each lead character beforehand leaving a lot of character backstory nonexistent. The screenplay gives a brief overlay of each of Ben's and Bea's backstory in a scene montage and it's the error of telling over showing, and it doesn't work, leaving a rushed characterization of both characters that cheapens the film.Supporting characters feel like caricatures and don't add anything to the story. No supporting character was memorable. Some corny dialogue and meta rom-com instances that seem shoehorned in. Also, I wish Darren Barnet (Paxton from the TV series Never Have I Ever (2020-2023)) had more scenes, dialogue and that he would've been the guy Bea ended up with if there was an unexpected surprise, twist ending, instead of the ""enemies to lovers"" and ""stuck together so they'll end up together"" overused romance tropes. But the screenplay is too safe and screenwriters would never be bold enough to rise up to a different, atypical ending like this.I did like that the majority of the film was set in Australia and a few of the songs used in the film's soundtrack.It's ironic that Dermot Mulroney and Rachel Griffiths are in this sucky rom-com when blasting back to the past to 1997, both Mulroney (as the leading man and love interest) and Griffiths (in a supporting role) starred in a first rate quality rom-com, My Best Friend's Wedding. This is why most of my fave rom-coms are from the '90s and the 2000s. When quality storytelling, chemistry, and character development reigned in comparison to this current rom-com garbage.Anyone But You is a derivative, formulaic rom-com that's ultimately unmemorable, vapid rom-com plot, and a waste of time. Just casually watch it once it comes out on streaming if you have nothing else to watch and don't care about draining 1 hour 43 minutes of your time."
"Anyone But You","dogonlion","10 February 2024",110,"Everything in this movie feels forced. The comedy is like ""please laugh, please laugh"". I guess that works on some. Nothing flows naturally. The way they love at first sight and all of the sudden start bickering is unrealistic. The bickering is annoying. Sydney Sweeney is a really good actress, I really liked her in The White Lotus, but she's hasn't been in a movie that uses her full potential yet. The movie is full of cliches. It even has the funny black friend with no love life. I'm really shocked by how much money this movie made. I guess as long as those kinds of movies make money they'll keep the same formula and keep factory produce them and soon will use artificial intelligence to write them."

It had some cute scenes. I gotta say the ensemble was pretty good if I laughed it was always because something one of them said. They were a bunch of goofy characters. I also enjoyed dermot mulroney's character when he was learning how to dive and the reoccurance of that at the end of the movie. It made me giggle.But I gotta say... the dialogue was very mediocre and at times just not good at all. It just lacked depth which again didn't expect it to have depth but still could have been better."

Overall, an incredibly formulaic Rom-Com that tries way too hard to capitalize on the popularity and looks of Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney, but fails hard as it is so predictable and barely funny.Bad Direction (The whole movie just feels like the studio shelled out something to tick boxes rather than make a well thought-out comedy (this included plot concepts, wardrobing, and jokes) because that's what they think the audience 'wants' as they try too hard to be 'modern,' meaning the director couldn't make any creative decisions; the direction on both a macro and microscale feels very formulaic to other Rom-Coms; the direction of actors is very bad as he does not establish any chemistry for the cast as all the performances feel mundane and toneless; the storytelling is a formulaic and predictable Rom-Com), Bad Acting (Bad to Pretty Bad from Sydney Sweeney (The overall performance feels mundane and toneless and she fails to establish any chemistry with Glen Powell, but she does have some moments where she does a decent to pretty good job), Decent to Pretty Good from Glen Powell (The only positive performance in the movie as he holds his own and leads the movie well as a Rom-Com lead (it's just the material is so bad he can only do so much)), Decent from Alexandra Shipp (Actually holds her own well and shows some a little range (which is a lot given this movie)), Bad from GaTa (Cannot match the levels of any of the other actors and feels very toneless with little effort), Pretty Bad from Hadley Robinson (Just doesn't offer anything), Decent from Michelle Hurd (Shows some experience and decent timing), Decent from Dermot Mulroney (Has some charisma and timing), Decent from Charlee Fraser (The most surprising performance of the movie as she holds her own fairly well and establishes some charm and chemistry with Glen Powell), Very Bad from the rest of the cast (Just a lot of toneless and stereotypical Rom-Com performances; there is no chemistry in the entire cast)), Very Bad Story (The concept is a modern retelling of Shakespeare's 'Much Ado About Nothing,' but it does not do anything to be unique as it just follows the cookie cutter Rom-Com plot (mixed with forced modern references); the story construction is incredibly formulaic as each scene is incredibly predictable on what is going to happen and where it is going to go; because the movie is so predictable, there is a flow because it just follows this boilerplate to a tea; the character writing is terrible as all the characters as so shallow and stereotypical to Rom-Coms (and things are brought up for characters that never get addressed or add more depth to the characters)), Very Bad Screenplay (The dialogue is atrocious and very predictable (the movie forces in so many modern references that it just feels like they are pandering to the youth rather than writing realistic dialogue); the joke hit rate is probably 1 out of every 5 jokes (and some of the jokes are just so stupid that its cringe at how they even made this movie); the symbolism is incredibly overt (with the quotes from the source material and the messages of the story being overlaid onto the screen); the foreshadowing is incredibly overt that it makes the movie incredibly predictable), Decent Score; Decent Soundtrack (Did enjoy the songs they chose), Pretty Good Cinematography (Very polished as you could tell the studio put in a lot of money to make this movie), Pretty Bad Sound (Some of the sound effects are just off from what happened), Decent Editing (The actual edit was very polished and felt like it had a big budget; the cut for the movie just feels weird as it is obvious where they did reshoots and what was originally shot), Good Costumes (They made a very conscious decision with what each character was wearing to get people to watch this movie (and I respect that)), Plot Structure followed the source material's and Rom-Com template to a tee (which made the movie incredibly formulaic and predictable), Pacing was decent (as it kept the Rom-Com pace), Climax was so forced and incredibly formulaic (which made me cringe very hard when watching this movie), Tone was very similar to other Rom-Coms (especially from the early 2010s), It was so obvious where there were reshoots for this movie as some of the scenes were so bad and some were more tolerable."
"Anyone But You","masonsaul","30 December 2023",710,"Anyone But You is an enjoyably cynical rom com that still has plenty of heartfelt romance at its centre. Just getting one of these theatrically released currently is kind of a miracle and it plays squarely to the genre's strengths. All its beats are predictable in the best way.Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell are on their way to becoming genuine movie stars and this film only further solidifies that. The constant barbs they send each other's way for the majority of the film are really funny and the chemistry they're constantly trying to deny has a real spark to it.This isn't Will Gluck's first rom com and that's apparent in the good ways. The broad physical comedy is balanced nicely by the snappy wit interspersed throughout and it's surprisingly epic (a lot more helicopter stuff than expected). A good soundtrack always helps with this genre and the one here nails it."
"Anyone But You","Remmuchan","27 December 2023",310,"I cannot for the life of me understand how this ended up being a movie shown in theaters.

It was the biggest waste of my time ever.I cannot tell you how many times I cringed watching this and how many times I wanted it to just end. The acting was AWFUL, especially from the lead actress who tried so hard to act seductive but it just came off as terrible. Everything about this movie made no sense. The plot line was awful. It felt like watching a really cheesy Netflix rom-com but a hundred times worse. The shocking nude scenes just added to its awfulness.I can't get over how bad this is and I really think they just wanted to make something to tick all the boxes of what a rom-com is except it did not tick any of those boxes at all. Terrible acting, terrible movie, terrible plot line, terrible directing, terrible EVERYTHING.I HATED this movie. Avoid at all costs."
"Anyone But You","MichaelByTheSea","26 December 2023",910,"This was like an R rated raunchy Hallmark movie where people actually have sex. I can do without the miscommunication trope that drove apart a couple that seemed to be connecting, but I enjoyed the banter and really enjoyed the stars.""Serious"" critics typically don't appreciate the rom-com genre and judge them harshly. I went with my adult children and we all loved the movie. My kids make fun of my love for Hallmark movies, but even they liked this one. We laughed out loud repeatedly and walked out smiling. I love that feeling.Sure, the script is flawed, the plot's ridiculous, and some of the dialogue is a bit off, but Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney light up the screen with their amazing chemistry. They're extraordinary specimens and look like they spend 6 hours a day in the gym, but I also like them as actors. Glen Powell was really good in another enjoyable modern rom-com with Zoey Deutch called ""Set It Up"" and he's fearless here, especially with the over the top body humor.Sydney Sweeney is certainly voluptuous, and gorgeous to look at, but she's also established herself as a great actress in more critic friendly shows like ""Euphoria"" and ""White Lotus"". Edgy and dark is fine, and it certainly gets taken more seriously by the critics, but I prefer getting lost in an escapist rom-com that doesn't involve terrible people doing terrible things.I want more of this."

"Anyone But You","NatKaminska","28 December 2023",110,"I need to warn those of you who want to spend your money on this thing: don't do it, not worth it. I watched the movie and it was horrible. It tried to be a charming '90s and '2000s rom-com, yet it failed in every department except with the male lead. Glen Powell is the only good thing about this movie.'Anyone but you' is full of cliches and while you can do cliches in a good way, and make genuine, great gem of a specific genre, this is not the case here. The movie is boring, shallow, cringe comedy with typical cringe, over-the-top, not-funny jokes, maybe 1 joke lands in the entire movie, that's how bad it is. The supposedly 'hilarious' nude scene on the cliff, especially the part when Powell is bending over, completely naked, holding his balls in his hands, is the next level of cringe, nothing funny, nothing charming, just cringe, awkward, awful. It's also full of heavy, not subtle, and obvious cultural references as if the writers just wrote down popular internet memes. Man, these writers really don't have any respect for the viewers. I basically wanted to walk out of this movie after the first 15 minutes.The romance part is badly done as well. The chemistry is average at best, just like a normal chemistry between two beautiful people - they are easy on the eyes oh right, like most people in this industry, but nothing more. They are not Mulder and Scully or Hanks and Ryan. Another problem with the main couple is that only Powell is to some degree likable, even tho the script doesn't make his character particularly likable, Powell's natural charisma and charm do the trick. With Sweeney that doesn't exist, she is utterly unlikeable as Bea, and this flaw kills the romance and fun completely. Despite what was said about this duo during the last summer and what some of their blind stans and the media still say now, they don't fit together as a rom-com couple at all!The screenplay itself doesn't help the actors achieve any chemistry, as the entire story is incredibly predictable, and thus boring, with awful dialogues and wooden acting most of the time.Nothing really happens in this movie! Any romantic comedy has to have some stakes in the relationship, some solid drama, and funny, unexpected twists and turns that make sense at least in the fictional universe. In this movie, the conflict that starts Ben and Bea's feud doesn't even make sense! Literally, one minute of simple explanation would clear the air between them, as they are visibly attracted to each other, from the first moment they meet. So the whole basis of this film, that they hate each other, doesn't make sense. We needed some stronger reason for the hate here.Yes, I'm aware that this movie is based on Shakespeare's play 'Much Ado About Nothing', and that one point of that play is that a great fuss/drama between the protagonists started from something insignificant ('nothing'), but every artist, and not only an artist but average person, knows that film is a completely different medium than a theater play, and what worked in a play about romance, written in Shakespeare's times, doesn't work as well in a modern, romantic comedy film. This movie isn't written intelligently enough to make it work either. Again, for the plot to be compelling in this film, we needed a stronger reason for hatred between the main characters, and the development of the characters, and we got neither of those things. Throughout the film, the characters are basic sketches, and we don't know much about them till the end.Then, during the next two, remaining acts of the movie, also nothing really happens. They decide to fake that they are together out of the blue, and their reasons for it are also simply not good enough for the audience to care about the characters and the story. Throughout the entire film, we don't see at all that Ben genuinely desires his ex, and Bea's parents don't have enough of the presence, are completely flat, insignificant characters for the audience to believe or care that she needs to lie to them, which were the two main reasons for the masquerade. Therefore, another giant flaw of the script: the motivations of the main characters that are supposed to push the plot forward are insufficient to be credible and interesting to the audience.In general, the problem is that nothing is fleshed out in 'Anyone but You' - not the main storyline, not the two main leads, not the background characters, drama, or comedy.The 'meta' lines in the script, the kinda 'wink- wink we know it's typical rom-com trope' also don't work because for this to work, the entire script would have to be much more intelligent and satirical, and it isn't smart or a satire at all! It just tried to cheat the audience by doing this, or the writers gave themselves an easy excuse for the rest of their bad writing, and again - it doesn't work. Nothing works in this movie.Yet another big problem: Sydney doesn't have a talent for comedy, sorry. Her delivery is very bland and too stiff, her character is flat, like cut out of a cardboard figure. I just don't understand how someone like her could get the role specifically in romantic comedy if she doesn't fit this role at all. Weren't there some other, better, and actually comedy-talented, cute actresses available during the casting process? Or was it just an easy money grab because it is Sydney Sweeney from 'Euphoria'?Glen is the only one who can be genuinely hilarious and gives his all, and that is not a surprise for anyone who follows his career. Glen already showed his comedy talent in Scream Queens but also proved it as Hangman in Top Gun. He is a very funny guy in real life too, as you can see in his interviews, so it's obvious comedy is natural for him. That's why he absolutely is in his element in this movie, and he 'feels it' but the problem is no one of the rest of the cast is, including Sydney. And Glen alone is still not good enough to save this movie.When you have such a difference in comedic chops between two leads in a romantic comedy that is a giant problem. I don't know if you noticed, but the hilarious thing is, you can already see in the trailers, that Sydney is not good at all in this movie. I remember that I commented her delivery is terrible the minute I watched the trailer!After I watched this movie, I definitely think Glen is much better in romantic comedies when paired with Zoey Deutch. Glen has a way better, more organic, and natural chemistry with Zoey than with Sydney, maybe because Zoey has a comedy talent just like Glen. I saw on Glen's IMDB that he is going to star in another comedy with Zoey, hopefully, better written than this one, so I will wait for it.To sum up, 'Anyone but You' is not worth one second of your time, your money, or any buzz, just wait for the the movie to appear on the streaming platforms. It doesn't have the great main couple, it doesn't have good background characters, it doesn't have the charm, wit, and natural flow that romantic comedies of the '90s or early '2000 had, like She's All That, Love Actually, Holiday, 10 Things I Hate About You, or How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.It simply doesn't have good or even decent writing! And I'm not the enemy of romantic comedies, I'm a woman and aspiring filmmaker, I love great romantic comedies just like any other great movie, of any other genre. But this movie is so bad, that I genuinely felt ashamed while watching it - I felt ashamed for the filmmakers who made this, especially the writers. Don't bother!"
"Anyone But You","SnoopyStyle","24 February 2024",610,"Bea (Sydney Sweeney) meets Ben (Glen Powell) in a coffee shop and they hook up. There are misunderstandings next morning and they leave angry. It turns out that his friend is marrying her sister. The two enemies have to attend a destination wedding in Australia.Sweeney and Powell are trying all kind of broad physical humor. They are both gorgeous and both have good charisma. Neither are outright comedians and that is important. They are mildly funny but are rarely the funniest part. The first big laugh is the WTF old guy while the two bicker. The butt grabbing scene kinda works, but the leads may be overshadowed by a koala. This duo tries very hard.

"Anyone But You","johnnymonsarrat","3 February 2024",410,"Hello again, fellow film travelers.I have to wonder what happened to the writing of this movie. There are some interesting and touching twists to the plot. But mainly it seems plot driven, not character driven. Characters don't make consistent choices with their personality or logic, for example what happens with the parents at the end.The male lead has an acting style that's full of confidence, but he's supposed to be a comic figure that has disabling phobias. God knows why he can barely swim but he can teach diving.The female lead, I take no pleasure in saying this, tends to speak at the other actors instead of to them.I get that the writers were trying to go for a Shakespeare type of thing, like Much Ado About Nothing, but the movie simply wasn't comedic enough to have unconvincing character choices. You can get away with a lot of goofy stuff in a slapstick comedy. But this had mostly drama. So the characters need to make sense.I am sorry. I really wanted to like this.There were hints of genius.

We left around the halfway mark because I kept hoping that it would improve - a waste of time & our weekly movie budget. The actors were given dialog that was juvenile and scene set-ups that were embarrassing. Lots of gratitious nudity and shots of partial nudity. Anyone interested in seeing this movie should just watch the trailer - it gives viewers a good picture of what they'll see at the theater so they don't waste their time sitting through a really bad movie. It was great seeing Bryan Brown but I wish he had chosen a better vehicle in which to appear than this dreck.

"Anyone But You","DeanAmythe","4 January 2024",410,"Never been into romcoms all that much (I watch movies alone all day as a true cinglephile), though I acknowledge their importance in filling the void for comfort watches: predictable, feel-good, and just the right amount of schmaltz - perfect for a night out (or in). Their template structure isn't so much a concern rather than an obstacle to overcome, which can be achieved with a fun gimmick of some sort, or, simply, by hitting the comedic marks. If this genre wants to see its resurgence these points are vital, and last year's NO HARD FEELINGS was eager to prove that, a return to form yet still raunchy and imbued with a surprising air of maturity - and even when the jokes didn't land, there was still enjoyment to be found in the excellent(ly cast) leads. ANYONE BUT YOU is as back-to-basics as it could get and appears to be, to a certain extent, aware of that, though here the drive to still be its own thing is completely absent. What immediately stands out is the central 'do-they, don't-they', which pretty much feeds directly into the classic plot structure and is barely taken advantage of. When it is being used for comedic purposes, it easily produces the highlights of the film, like the view/spider scene. Most of this, though, is by-the-numbers and safe, lacking any edge or remarkable features aside from the leads' sex appeal (on that front, the quality of the casting is equal to NO HARD FEELINGS). Speaking of them, Powell is as fun as expected - he would most likely be a solid movie star if the current Hollywood system allowed for those - but Sweeney? No clue what she's doing with those line reads, constantly sounding like a bad impression of an American high school girl with a ready disinterest in everything. Not that she has that much to work with anyway, as the script suffers from eye-rollers of jokes, that first half especially bursting with ""did I just say that out loud?"" humor. My sold out screening was awfully silent through most of this, though maybe they were just there for the aforementioned hotties. Just so you know: you don't get a (proper) view of Sweeney's melons, but you do get to see a squeezed Australian glans. 4/10."

"Anyone But You","ethanbresnett","6 January 2024",710,"Anyone But You caught me a little bit by surprise I must say. Perhaps that's because my expectations were quite low, but they really needn't have been as this film is a really solid romcom.Primarily this comes from Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney. A romcom lives and dies by its romantic leads, and they are both great in this, nailing the weird and evolving chemistry between their two characters. They are each decently well written, feeling believable and engaging.On top of this, there is a fairly forgettable but perfectly pleasant assortment of supporting characters who add some extra levels of humour to the piece.Speaking of humour, it is a bit hit and miss in this film. There aren't many big laughs, but it is amusing and does have a light and goofy tone throughout that is befitting of any romcom.Now, this film doesn't really reinvent the wheel in any way. It has all the same story beats as most romcoms and doesn't take too many risks. Therefore the plot is fairly mediocre and (as with practically all romcoms) is far too predictable. This never really gets in the way of the fun though, but the inevitable ending does make it feel a teensy bit too long.Overall though I think this is a really solid film. It has a good tone, a couple of engaging leads, and will give you a few laughs too."
"Anyone But You","tm-sheehan","5 January 2024",610,"My Review. Anyone But You
My Rating. 6:10Very very loosely based on Shakespeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"" with even a few quotations in the background and title cards this pleasant enough rom com reminds me of a line from a 16 th Century play The Merchant of Venice by same William Shakespeare, ""All that glisters is not gold"".Which of course translates in today's language ""All that glitters is not gold "".Anyone But You has a pleasant cast set in and around Sydney which is fun to spot locations like the QVB building, and our beautiful harbour vistas and pristine beaches.I was reminded of a far superior Classic romantic comedy ""My Best Friend's Wedding "" 1997 when I saw the actor playing the brides father Dermot Mulroney who achieved great success playing a similar lead 26 years ago to Glen Powell who plays Ben the romantic lead man in this movie.I enjoyed both the young leads Sydney Sweeney who plays Bea and Glen Powell who play the star crossed lovers .The differences and similarities for me in great romance comedies with weddings like My Best Friends Wedding and more recently Crazy Rich Asians is obvious they all look fabulous with surroundings that celebrate the affluence of wealthy privileged people .Where they differ from each other is in the quality of the script writing in this case by Ilana Wolpert and Will Gluck.Light comedy can be clever if it's not pretentious why try and improve on Shakespeare? It's an impossible task.Anyone But You is entertaining but parts of it I found really irritating and contrived.Adding a same sex wedding was a nice modern touch but it's the most heterosexual same sex wedding I've ever seen not one Gay in this village except Claudia and Halle the betrothed couple.The most irritating characters for me were the parents of the brides played by Dermot Mulroney, Rachel Griffiths, Bryan Brown and Michelle Hurd they all seemed to be trying to hard .I can't be to critical of this light comedy that probably appeals to a younger audience demographic than myself .I hope it succeeds overseas as we need to export more home grown cinema product from Australia but we can't just rely on great scenery and cute animal platitudes like winking koalas ."
"Anyone But You","psxexperten","9 February 2024",110,"Horrible, don't waste your time
Weak story, unnecessarily extensive vulgar language, and excessive nudity humiliates the actors. Embarrassing movie that degrades men and women and shows no imagination. It is very sad to believe that this movie appeals to people. Downright stupid with no redeeming qualities.I had respect for some of these actors before I watched this movie. All I can say is that perhaps they will do anything for money. I cannot see any other reason to have participated in this film and I am scared for any teenagers or young adults that are entertained by showing off your body and acting like adolescent fools."
"Anyone But You","movieman6-413-929510","5 January 2024",510,"Anyone But You is a new romantic comedy directed, written and produced in part by Will Gluck, director of Easy A and Friends with Benefits.Bea (Sydney Sweeney) and Ben (Glen Powell) haven't seen each other since a first date. When they are both invited to the same wedding, the two meet again.They learn that people are trying to hook them up so they don't cause further problems during the wedding. This is why they pretend, to get rid of the fuss.Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell have good chemistry together in the film and both know how to play well and playfully with and against each other. Despite their chemistry, the overall film is unfortunately more on the standard side of a romantic comedy. This gives the film game its well-known and predictable sides. Other moments come across as a bit too forced. For co-writer Ilana Wolpert, this is only her first written film story.Another downside of the film is the amount of extra characters. Many of these extras bring their own kind of comedy, but otherwise have little real use in the film. With a few fewer of these extras, the film could have been better focused, with a shorter running time."

"Anyone But You","alyetc","28 December 2023",510,"We've seen a million movies set at weddings before - where even the couple getting married gets invested in the main couples status. So I knew a lot of the tropes would be the same, but it was the same but a bit worse. The main couple story I actually really liked, I thought they were hilarious and cute and beat out other movies with the same storyline. It was everything else that fell short. The background characters felt cheesy and fake. All surface level gags or you didn't really get to know them, nothing felt genuine - case in point Bea's parents were incredibly unrealistic, no ones that out of touch. Even Bea's background felt half-done, never explaining why she didn't want law school."

Its repetitive and cliché romantic comedy storyline lacked originality, leaving the audience unengaged. The attempts at humor fell flat, resulting in a tedious and cringe-worthy viewing experience. To add to the disappointment, the lead actress's annoying voice only added to the overall lackluster quality of the film, making it a forgettable and uninspiring cinematic endeavor. Terrible acting and story. I don't understand the high rating of this movie, or the hype. Save your time and skip this one. The movie is downright horrible, with uncomfortable scenes that make you question their choices. Shame on them for delivering such a poorly written script, leading to an overall disappointing and regrettable cinematic experience."
"Anyone But You","barbett-1","1 January 2024",510,"Neither brilliant nor dreadful, ""Anyone But You"" features a cast of characters that are unbelievably attractive and, apparently, insanely wealthy. It stars Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeny's breasts in the formulatic equivalent of a Hallmark Movie knock-off. You know the drill - two perfect young people meet, are instantly attracted to each other, are separated by a misunderstanding with hilarious hijinks ensuing. The misunderstanding is eventually resolved, love blooms once more, and all ends well.What sets this film apart is excellent cinematography with lovely wide-angle views of the Australian countryside. The supporting cast is very capable although the Australian men are played as oafish stereotypes. Glen Powell plays his part well, but Sydney Sweeny appears to be reading her lines from a teleprompter offscreen. Not the worst movie out this holiday season and enjoyable as long as you refrain from high expectations."
"Anyone But You","pkertes-59666","5 January 2024",410,"I went to see this movie because I am a sucker for a romantic comedy, even the average ones (and let's face it, most of them are). Having seen the trailer, I had low expectations, yet this film still managed to come it at an even lower level.Boy meets girl, they hit it off briefly, there is a misunderstanding and when they reconnect through a friend/family wedding, they hate each other. Except as anyone could predict, ultimately they don't really, but it takes an eternity of inauthentic, puerile dross to get there. No tissues needed here.The acting is generally average to poor, and local actors like Rachel Griffiths and Bryan Brown (much of it filmed in Australia) do the minimum required, and are completely wasted here. The script is juvenile, facile and has little in common with reality. The direction is pedestrian and much of the movie is a travel ad for Sydney. Throw in plastic, unlikeable characters and a healthy dose of gratuitous nudity. The attempts at comedy are almost laughable as that, and what little romance eventuates at the end fails to convince after nearly two hours of tripe beforehand.Not recommended, even if you are a fan of the genre."
"Anyone But You","trinaboice","8 January 2024",410,"IN A NUTSHELL:
After an amazing first date, Bea and Ben's fiery attraction turns ice-cold until they find themselves unexpectedly reunited at a destination wedding in Australia that their exes also attend. So, they do what any two mature adults would do: pretend to be a couple amidst the fighting.The film was directed by Will Gluck, who also wrote it with Ilana Wolpert.Ultimately, this is like a rated R Hallmark movie with lots of raunch.THINGS I LIKED:
There is plenty of eye candy here for everyone. The cast is filled with good-looking people and includes Sydney Sweeney, Glen Powell, Alexandra Shipp, Hadley Robinson, GaTa, Michelle Hurd, Dermot Mulroney, Rachel Griffiths, Bryan Brown, and more.Sydney Sweeney was bit by a spider in the movie while filming. That famous clip was posted online and got a lot of stir.We get to visit Australia during the film.The cast is diverse, offering a variety of stories about romance and love.The last scene takes clips from the whole movie and has all of the actors sing the same song for a feel-good moment.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Sure, everyone in the cast is hot, but the script is garbage. It sounded like it was written by a trashy version of Chat GPT.It's supposed to be funny, but it's pathetic how they are instantly super ugly and mean-spirited to each other when they have a miscommunication.It's SUPER predictable.Cliched end-of-movie singing, dancing scene.So much fighting.So many awkward moments.They say the movie is loosely based on Shakepeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"", but I think the Bard would be disgusted by the lack of intelligent language in the script. So many F-bombs. One similarity is that they get a wedding cake from a shop called ""Dogberry's"", which is the name of a character in the play.I cringed and rolled my eyes so many times.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
This movie is definitely not appropriate for kids. It portrays unhealthy relationships and extremely bad behavior.Kids will be completely bored because it's mostly adults talking to each other.Profanity and lots of F-bombs
A lesbian couple kisses and gets married
We see a topless woman
We see several shirtless men
A couple gropes each other inside their shorts.Two women wear bikini tops that barely cover anything.We see a ton of cleavage
A lot of sexual innuendo. We see an unmarried couple in the shower and bed together.We see two men smoke a joint.!"
"Anyone But You","ambusched94","31 December 2023",210,"A forgettable, expendable rom-com where all the somewhat funny, shock value scenes are exposed in the theatrical trailer and there is hardly any laugh-out-loud scenes in this film overall.While Glen Powell has the comedy chops and romantic charm for this film genre, to my astonishment it's the EXACT OPPOSITE for Sydney Sweeney. Her line delivery is dull and she has the same facial expressions, blank stare, dead eyes for most scenes in Anyone But You. You can tell she's acting as in she's not embodying the character in the story and she's simply reading the lines, not conveying any natural nuances in her character each time she does this. Sweeney's crying scene in the taxi felt unnaturally forced. I was surprised her acting was half-a**ed, whereas in the TV series Euphoria (2019-present) her acting feels natural. Or highly likely that she's a limited-range, one-note actress that can only do dark, coming-of-age drama genre and fails at rom-com. IMO, Powell and Sweeney had the most chemistry when their characters were arguing and hating each other. When they got all lovey dovey, the on-screen chemistry felt forced and it was lacking that romantic spark between their characters. I was not invested enough in their progressing relationship to care once they officially got together in the end.So one, I feel like Sweeney largely ruins the film with her bland acting and line delivery, and lack of emotiveness. A better choice for the lead actress in this film should've been a comedic actress or an actress who can deftly juggle comedic timing and dramatic, emotional scenes. If this film was made and released in the 2000s decade for example, Amanda Bynes would be a prime choice for the role of Bea. And two, the character development is lacking and backstory are just tacked-on but don't add any characterization substance. The screenplay pushes the two characters to meet instantaneously at the start of the film, so viewers don't get any individual scenes of each lead character beforehand leaving a lot of character backstory nonexistent. The screenplay gives a brief overlay of each of Ben's and Bea's backstory in a scene montage and it's the error of telling over showing, and it doesn't work, leaving a rushed characterization of both characters that cheapens the film.Supporting characters feel like caricatures and don't add anything to the story. No supporting character was memorable. Some corny dialogue and meta rom-com instances that seem shoehorned in. Also, I wish Darren Barnet (Paxton from the TV series Never Have I Ever (2020-2023)) had more scenes, dialogue and that he would've been the guy Bea ended up with if there was an unexpected surprise, twist ending, instead of the ""enemies to lovers"" and ""stuck together so they'll end up together"" overused romance tropes. But the screenplay is too safe and screenwriters would never be bold enough to rise up to a different, atypical ending like this.I did like that the majority of the film was set in Australia and a few of the songs used in the film's soundtrack.It's ironic that Dermot Mulroney and Rachel Griffiths are in this sucky rom-com when blasting back to the past to 1997, both Mulroney (as the leading man and love interest) and Griffiths (in a supporting role) starred in a first rate quality rom-com, My Best Friend's Wedding. This is why most of my fave rom-coms are from the '90s and the 2000s. When quality storytelling, chemistry, and character development reigned in comparison to this current rom-com garbage.Anyone But You is a derivative, formulaic rom-com that's ultimately unmemorable, vapid rom-com plot, and a waste of time. Just casually watch it once it comes out on streaming if you have nothing else to watch and don't care about draining 1 hour 43 minutes of your time."
"Anyone But You","dogonlion","10 February 2024",110,"Everything in this movie feels forced. The comedy is like ""please laugh, please laugh"". I guess that works on some. Nothing flows naturally. The way they love at first sight and all of the sudden start bickering is unrealistic. The bickering is annoying. Sydney Sweeney is a really good actress, I really liked her in The White Lotus, but she's hasn't been in a movie that uses her full potential yet. The movie is full of cliches. It even has the funny black friend with no love life. I'm really shocked by how much money this movie made. I guess as long as those kinds of movies make money they'll keep the same formula and keep factory produce them and soon will use artificial intelligence to write them."

It had some cute scenes. I gotta say the ensemble was pretty good if I laughed it was always because something one of them said. They were a bunch of goofy characters. I also enjoyed dermot mulroney's character when he was learning how to dive and the reoccurance of that at the end of the movie. It made me giggle.But I gotta say... the dialogue was very mediocre and at times just not good at all. It just lacked depth which again didn't expect it to have depth but still could have been better."

Overall, an incredibly formulaic Rom-Com that tries way too hard to capitalize on the popularity and looks of Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney, but fails hard as it is so predictable and barely funny.Bad Direction (The whole movie just feels like the studio shelled out something to tick boxes rather than make a well thought-out comedy (this included plot concepts, wardrobing, and jokes) because that's what they think the audience 'wants' as they try too hard to be 'modern,' meaning the director couldn't make any creative decisions; the direction on both a macro and microscale feels very formulaic to other Rom-Coms; the direction of actors is very bad as he does not establish any chemistry for the cast as all the performances feel mundane and toneless; the storytelling is a formulaic and predictable Rom-Com), Bad Acting (Bad to Pretty Bad from Sydney Sweeney (The overall performance feels mundane and toneless and she fails to establish any chemistry with Glen Powell, but she does have some moments where she does a decent to pretty good job), Decent to Pretty Good from Glen Powell (The only positive performance in the movie as he holds his own and leads the movie well as a Rom-Com lead (it's just the material is so bad he can only do so much)), Decent from Alexandra Shipp (Actually holds her own well and shows some a little range (which is a lot given this movie)), Bad from GaTa (Cannot match the levels of any of the other actors and feels very toneless with little effort), Pretty Bad from Hadley Robinson (Just doesn't offer anything), Decent from Michelle Hurd (Shows some experience and decent timing), Decent from Dermot Mulroney (Has some charisma and timing), Decent from Charlee Fraser (The most surprising performance of the movie as she holds her own fairly well and establishes some charm and chemistry with Glen Powell), Very Bad from the rest of the cast (Just a lot of toneless and stereotypical Rom-Com performances; there is no chemistry in the entire cast)), Very Bad Story (The concept is a modern retelling of Shakespeare's 'Much Ado About Nothing,' but it does not do anything to be unique as it just follows the cookie cutter Rom-Com plot (mixed with forced modern references); the story construction is incredibly formulaic as each scene is incredibly predictable on what is going to happen and where it is going to go; because the movie is so predictable, there is a flow because it just follows this boilerplate to a tea; the character writing is terrible as all the characters as so shallow and stereotypical to Rom-Coms (and things are brought up for characters that never get addressed or add more depth to the characters)), Very Bad Screenplay (The dialogue is atrocious and very predictable (the movie forces in so many modern references that it just feels like they are pandering to the youth rather than writing realistic dialogue); the joke hit rate is probably 1 out of every 5 jokes (and some of the jokes are just so stupid that its cringe at how they even made this movie); the symbolism is incredibly overt (with the quotes from the source material and the messages of the story being overlaid onto the screen); the foreshadowing is incredibly overt that it makes the movie incredibly predictable), Decent Score; Decent Soundtrack (Did enjoy the songs they chose), Pretty Good Cinematography (Very polished as you could tell the studio put in a lot of money to make this movie), Pretty Bad Sound (Some of the sound effects are just off from what happened), Decent Editing (The actual edit was very polished and felt like it had a big budget; the cut for the movie just feels weird as it is obvious where they did reshoots and what was originally shot), Good Costumes (They made a very conscious decision with what each character was wearing to get people to watch this movie (and I respect that)), Plot Structure followed the source material's and Rom-Com template to a tee (which made the movie incredibly formulaic and predictable), Pacing was decent (as it kept the Rom-Com pace), Climax was so forced and incredibly formulaic (which made me cringe very hard when watching this movie), Tone was very similar to other Rom-Coms (especially from the early 2010s), It was so obvious where there were reshoots for this movie as some of the scenes were so bad and some were more tolerable."
"Anyone But You","masonsaul","30 December 2023",710,"Anyone But You is an enjoyably cynical rom com that still has plenty of heartfelt romance at its centre. Just getting one of these theatrically released currently is kind of a miracle and it plays squarely to the genre's strengths. All its beats are predictable in the best way.Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell are on their way to becoming genuine movie stars and this film only further solidifies that. The constant barbs they send each other's way for the majority of the film are really funny and the chemistry they're constantly trying to deny has a real spark to it.This isn't Will Gluck's first rom com and that's apparent in the good ways. The broad physical comedy is balanced nicely by the snappy wit interspersed throughout and it's surprisingly epic (a lot more helicopter stuff than expected). A good soundtrack always helps with this genre and the one here nails it."

It was the biggest waste of my time ever.I cannot tell you how many times I cringed watching this and how many times I wanted it to just end. The acting was AWFUL, especially from the lead actress who tried so hard to act seductive but it just came off as terrible. Everything about this movie made no sense. The plot line was awful. It felt like watching a really cheesy Netflix rom-com but a hundred times worse. The shocking nude scenes just added to its awfulness.I can't get over how bad this is and I really think they just wanted to make something to tick all the boxes of what a rom-com is except it did not tick any of those boxes at all.

"Anyone But You","MichaelByTheSea","26 December 2023",910,"This was like an R rated raunchy Hallmark movie where people actually have sex. I can do without the miscommunication trope that drove apart a couple that seemed to be connecting, but I enjoyed the banter and really enjoyed the stars.""Serious"" critics typically don't appreciate the rom-com genre and judge them harshly. I went with my adult children and we all loved the movie. My kids make fun of my love for Hallmark movies, but even they liked this one. We laughed out loud repeatedly and walked out smiling. I love that feeling.Sure, the script is flawed, the plot's ridiculous, and some of the dialogue is a bit off, but Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney light up the screen with their amazing chemistry. They're extraordinary specimens and look like they spend 6 hours a day in the gym, but I also like them as actors. Glen Powell was really good in another enjoyable modern rom-com with Zoey Deutch called ""Set It Up"" and he's fearless here, especially with the over the top body humor.Sydney Sweeney is certainly voluptuous, and gorgeous to look at, but she's also established herself as a great actress in more critic friendly shows like ""Euphoria"" and ""White Lotus"". Edgy and dark is fine, and it certainly gets taken more seriously by the critics, but I prefer getting lost in an escapist rom-com that doesn't involve terrible people doing terrible things.I want more of this."

"Anyone But You","NatKaminska","28 December 2023",110,"I need to warn those of you who want to spend your money on this thing: don't do it, not worth it. I watched the movie and it was horrible. It tried to be a charming '90s and '2000s rom-com, yet it failed in every department except with the male lead. Glen Powell is the only good thing about this movie.'Anyone but you' is full of cliches and while you can do cliches in a good way, and make genuine, great gem of a specific genre, this is not the case here. The movie is boring, shallow, cringe comedy with typical cringe, over-the-top, not-funny jokes, maybe 1 joke lands in the entire movie, that's how bad it is. The supposedly 'hilarious' nude scene on the cliff, especially the part when Powell is bending over, completely naked, holding his balls in his hands, is the next level of cringe, nothing funny, nothing charming, just cringe, awkward, awful. It's also full of heavy, not subtle, and obvious cultural references as if the writers just wrote down popular internet memes. Man, these writers really don't have any respect for the viewers. I basically wanted to walk out of this movie after the first 15 minutes.The romance part is badly done as well. The chemistry is average at best, just like a normal chemistry between two beautiful people - they are easy on the eyes oh right, like most people in this industry, but nothing more. They are not Mulder and Scully or Hanks and Ryan. Another problem with the main couple is that only Powell is to some degree likable, even tho the script doesn't make his character particularly likable, Powell's natural charisma and charm do the trick. With Sweeney that doesn't exist, she is utterly unlikeable as Bea, and this flaw kills the romance and fun completely. Despite what was said about this duo during the last summer and what some of their blind stans and the media still say now, they don't fit together as a rom-com couple at all!The screenplay itself doesn't help the actors achieve any chemistry, as the entire story is incredibly predictable, and thus boring, with awful dialogues and wooden acting most of the time.Nothing really happens in this movie! Any romantic comedy has to have some stakes in the relationship, some solid drama, and funny, unexpected twists and turns that make sense at least in the fictional universe. In this movie, the conflict that starts Ben and Bea's feud doesn't even make sense! Literally, one minute of simple explanation would clear the air between them, as they are visibly attracted to each other, from the first moment they meet. So the whole basis of this film, that they hate each other, doesn't make sense. We needed some stronger reason for the hate here.Yes, I'm aware that this movie is based on Shakespeare's play 'Much Ado About Nothing', and that one point of that play is that a great fuss/drama between the protagonists started from something insignificant ('nothing'), but every artist, and not only an artist but average person, knows that film is a completely different medium than a theater play, and what worked in a play about romance, written in Shakespeare's times, doesn't work as well in a modern, romantic comedy film. This movie isn't written intelligently enough to make it work either. Again, for the plot to be compelling in this film, we needed a stronger reason for hatred between the main characters, and the development of the characters, and we got neither of those things. Throughout the film, the characters are basic sketches, and we don't know much about them till the end.Then, during the next two, remaining acts of the movie, also nothing really happens. They decide to fake that they are together out of the blue, and their reasons for it are also simply not good enough for the audience to care about the characters and the story. Throughout the entire film, we don't see at all that Ben genuinely desires his ex, and Bea's parents don't have enough of the presence, are completely flat, insignificant characters for the audience to believe or care that she needs to lie to them, which were the two main reasons for the masquerade. Therefore, another giant flaw of the script: the motivations of the main characters that are supposed to push the plot forward are insufficient to be credible and interesting to the audience.In general, the problem is that nothing is fleshed out in 'Anyone but You' - not the main storyline, not the two main leads, not the background characters, drama, or comedy.The 'meta' lines in the script, the kinda 'wink- wink we know it's typical rom-com trope' also don't work because for this to work, the entire script would have to be much more intelligent and satirical, and it isn't smart or a satire at all! It just tried to cheat the audience by doing this, or the writers gave themselves an easy excuse for the rest of their bad writing, and again - it doesn't work. Nothing works in this movie.Yet another big problem: Sydney doesn't have a talent for comedy, sorry. Her delivery is very bland and too stiff, her character is flat, like cut out of a cardboard figure. I just don't understand how someone like her could get the role specifically in romantic comedy if she doesn't fit this role at all. Weren't there some other, better, and actually comedy-talented, cute actresses available during the casting process? Or was it just an easy money grab because it is Sydney Sweeney from 'Euphoria'?Glen is the only one who can be genuinely hilarious and gives his all, and that is not a surprise for anyone who follows his career. Glen already showed his comedy talent in Scream Queens but also proved it as Hangman in Top Gun. He is a very funny guy in real life too, as you can see in his interviews, so it's obvious comedy is natural for him. That's why he absolutely is in his element in this movie, and he 'feels it' but the problem is no one of the rest of the cast is, including Sydney. And Glen alone is still not good enough to save this movie.When you have such a difference in comedic chops between two leads in a romantic comedy that is a giant problem. I don't know if you noticed, but the hilarious thing is, you can already see in the trailers, that Sydney is not good at all in this movie. I remember that I commented her delivery is terrible the minute I watched the trailer!After I watched this movie, I definitely think Glen is much better in romantic comedies when paired with Zoey Deutch. Glen has a way better, more organic, and natural chemistry with Zoey than with Sydney, maybe because Zoey has a comedy talent just like Glen. I saw on Glen's IMDB that he is going to star in another comedy with Zoey, hopefully, better written than this one, so I will wait for it.To sum up, 'Anyone but You' is not worth one second of your time, your money, or any buzz, just wait for the the movie to appear on the streaming platforms. It doesn't have the great main couple, it doesn't have good background characters, it doesn't have the charm, wit, and natural flow that romantic comedies of the '90s or early '2000 had, like She's All That, Love Actually, Holiday, 10 Things I Hate About You, or How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.It simply doesn't have good or even decent writing! And I'm not the enemy of romantic comedies, I'm a woman and aspiring filmmaker, I love great romantic comedies just like any other great movie, of any other genre. But this movie is so bad, that I genuinely felt ashamed while watching it - I felt ashamed for the filmmakers who made this, especially the writers. Don't bother!"

They are both gorgeous and both have good charisma. Neither are outright comedians and that is important. They are mildly funny but are rarely the funniest part. The first big laugh is the WTF old guy while the two bicker. The butt grabbing scene kinda works, but the leads may be overshadowed by a koala. This duo tries very hard. It's so ridiculous that it's mildly funny."
"Anyone But You","johnnymonsarrat","3 February 2024",410,"Hello again, fellow film travelers.I have to wonder what happened to the writing of this movie. There are some interesting and touching twists to the plot. But mainly it seems plot driven, not character driven. Characters don't make consistent choices with their personality or logic, for example what happens with the parents at the end.The male lead has an acting style that's full of confidence, but he's supposed to be a comic figure that has disabling phobias. God knows why he can barely swim but he can teach diving.The female lead, I take no pleasure in saying this, tends to speak at the other actors instead of to them.I get that the writers were trying to go for a Shakespeare type of thing, like Much Ado About Nothing, but the movie simply wasn't comedic enough to have unconvincing character choices. You can get away with a lot of goofy stuff in a slapstick comedy. But this had mostly drama. So the characters need to make sense.I am sorry. I really wanted to like this.There were hints of genius. There was some good physical comedy and a few touchimg moments. But the cringe worthy flaws buried them."
"Anyone But You","gerrgrady-86307","27 December 2023",210,"My husband and I chose this movie as a Saturday treat. We left around the halfway mark because I kept hoping that it would improve - a waste of time & our weekly movie budget. The actors were given dialog that was juvenile and scene set-ups that were embarrassing. Lots of gratitious nudity and shots of partial nudity. Anyone interested in seeing this movie should just watch the trailer - it gives viewers a good picture of what they'll see at the theater so they don't waste their time sitting through a really bad movie. It was great seeing Bryan Brown but I wish he had chosen a better vehicle in which to appear than this dreck. I had greater expections for Glen Powell, but then maybe this is the level of his actual talent. Sad."
"Anyone But You","DeanAmythe","4 January 2024",410,"Never been into romcoms all that much (I watch movies alone all day as a true cinglephile), though I acknowledge their importance in filling the void for comfort watches: predictable, feel-good, and just the right amount of schmaltz - perfect for a night out (or in). Their template structure isn't so much a concern rather than an obstacle to overcome, which can be achieved with a fun gimmick of some sort, or, simply, by hitting the comedic marks. If this genre wants to see its resurgence these points are vital, and last year's NO HARD FEELINGS was eager to prove that, a return to form yet still raunchy and imbued with a surprising air of maturity - and even when the jokes didn't land, there was still enjoyment to be found in the excellent(ly cast) leads. ANYONE BUT YOU is as back-to-basics as it could get and appears to be, to a certain extent, aware of that, though here the drive to still be its own thing is completely absent. What immediately stands out is the central 'do-they, don't-they', which pretty much feeds directly into the classic plot structure and is barely taken advantage of. When it is being used for comedic purposes, it easily produces the highlights of the film, like the view/spider scene. Most of this, though, is by-the-numbers and safe, lacking any edge or remarkable features aside from the leads' sex appeal (on that front, the quality of the casting is equal to NO HARD FEELINGS). Speaking of them, Powell is as fun as expected - he would most likely be a solid movie star if the current Hollywood system allowed for those - but Sweeney? No clue what she's doing with those line reads, constantly sounding like a bad impression of an American high school girl with a ready disinterest in everything. Not that she has that much to work with anyway, as the script suffers from eye-rollers of jokes, that first half especially bursting with ""did I just say that out loud?"" humor. My sold out screening was awfully silent through most of this, though maybe they were just there for the aforementioned hotties. Just so you know: you don't get a (proper) view of Sweeney's melons, but you do get to see a squeezed Australian glans. 4/10."

I could feel my brain cells dying as I watched this absolute mess of a rom-com.Sydney Sweeney was horrible and has all but ruined her career. She could not make any part of her character believable. Very hard to watch.I'm embarrassed for Brian brown for having anything to do with this movie. He couldn't save this film from disaster.The script jumped all over the place and was so completely unrealistic... not once did the film make me believe any part of it could happen.The film relies on poor humour, And, what they don't show you in the commercials is that it's full of far-left LGBTQ propaganda.I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy."
"Anyone But You","ethanbresnett","6 January 2024",710,"Anyone But You caught me a little bit by surprise I must say. Perhaps that's because my expectations were quite low, but they really needn't have been as this film is a really solid romcom.Primarily this comes from Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney. A romcom lives and dies by its romantic leads, and they are both great in this, nailing the weird and evolving chemistry between their two characters. They are each decently well written, feeling believable and engaging.On top of this, there is a fairly forgettable but perfectly pleasant assortment of supporting characters who add some extra levels of humour to the piece.Speaking of humour, it is a bit hit and miss in this film. There aren't many big laughs, but it is amusing and does have a light and goofy tone throughout that is befitting of any romcom.Now, this film doesn't really reinvent the wheel in any way. It has all the same story beats as most romcoms and doesn't take too many risks. Therefore the plot is fairly mediocre and (as with practically all romcoms) is far too predictable. This never really gets in the way of the fun though, but the inevitable ending does make it feel a teensy bit too long.Overall though I think this is a really solid film. It has a good tone, a couple of engaging leads, and will give you a few laughs too."
"Anyone But You","tm-sheehan","5 January 2024",610,"My Review. Anyone But You
My Rating. 6:10Very very loosely based on Shakespeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"" with even a few quotations in the background and title cards this pleasant enough rom com reminds me of a line from a 16 th Century play The Merchant of Venice by same William Shakespeare, ""All that glisters is not gold"".Which of course translates in today's language ""All that glitters is not gold "".Anyone But You has a pleasant cast set in and around Sydney which is fun to spot locations like the QVB building, and our beautiful harbour vistas and pristine beaches.I was reminded of a far superior Classic romantic comedy ""My Best Friend's Wedding "" 1997 when I saw the actor playing the brides father Dermot Mulroney who achieved great success playing a similar lead 26 years ago to Glen Powell who plays Ben the romantic lead man in this movie.I enjoyed both the young leads Sydney Sweeney who plays Bea and Glen Powell who play the star crossed lovers .The differences and similarities for me in great romance comedies with weddings like My Best Friends Wedding and more recently Crazy Rich Asians is obvious they all look fabulous with surroundings that celebrate the affluence of wealthy privileged people .Where they differ from each other is in the quality of the script writing in this case by Ilana Wolpert and Will Gluck.Light comedy can be clever if it's not pretentious why try and improve on Shakespeare? It's an impossible task.Anyone But You is entertaining but parts of it I found really irritating and contrived.Adding a same sex wedding was a nice modern touch but it's the most heterosexual same sex wedding I've ever seen not one Gay in this village except Claudia and Halle the betrothed couple.The most irritating characters for me were the parents of the brides played by Dermot Mulroney, Rachel Griffiths, Bryan Brown and Michelle Hurd they all seemed to be trying to hard .I can't be to critical of this light comedy that probably appeals to a younger audience demographic than myself .I hope it succeeds overseas as we need to export more home grown cinema product from Australia but we can't just rely on great scenery and cute animal platitudes like winking koalas ."
"Anyone But You","psxexperten","9 February 2024",110,"Horrible, don't waste your time
Weak story, unnecessarily extensive vulgar language, and excessive nudity humiliates the actors. Embarrassing movie that degrades men and women and shows no imagination. It is very sad to believe that this movie appeals to people. Downright stupid with no redeeming qualities.I had respect for some of these actors before I watched this movie. All I can say is that perhaps they will do anything for money. I cannot see any other reason to have participated in this film and I am scared for any teenagers or young adults that are entertained by showing off your body and acting like adolescent fools."
"Anyone But You","movieman6-413-929510","5 January 2024",510,"Anyone But You is a new romantic comedy directed, written and produced in part by Will Gluck, director of Easy A and Friends with Benefits.Bea (Sydney Sweeney) and Ben (Glen Powell) haven't seen each other since a first date. When they are both invited to the same wedding, the two meet again.They learn that people are trying to hook them up so they don't cause further problems during the wedding. This is why they pretend, to get rid of the fuss.Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell have good chemistry together in the film and both know how to play well and playfully with and against each other. Despite their chemistry, the overall film is unfortunately more on the standard side of a romantic comedy. This gives the film game its well-known and predictable sides. Other moments come across as a bit too forced. For co-writer Ilana Wolpert, this is only her first written film story.Another downside of the film is the amount of extra characters. Many of these extras bring their own kind of comedy, but otherwise have little real use in the film. With a few fewer of these extras, the film could have been better focused, with a shorter running time."

"Anyone But You","alyetc","28 December 2023",510,"We've seen a million movies set at weddings before - where even the couple getting married gets invested in the main couples status. So I knew a lot of the tropes would be the same, but it was the same but a bit worse. The main couple story I actually really liked, I thought they were hilarious and cute and beat out other movies with the same storyline. It was everything else that fell short. The background characters felt cheesy and fake. All surface level gags or you didn't really get to know them, nothing felt genuine - case in point Bea's parents were incredibly unrealistic, no ones that out of touch. Even Bea's background felt half-done, never explaining why she didn't want law school."

Its repetitive and cliché romantic comedy storyline lacked originality, leaving the audience unengaged. The attempts at humor fell flat, resulting in a tedious and cringe-worthy viewing experience. To add to the disappointment, the lead actress's annoying voice only added to the overall lackluster quality of the film, making it a forgettable and uninspiring cinematic endeavor. Terrible acting and story. I don't understand the high rating of this movie, or the hype. Save your time and skip this one. The movie is downright horrible, with uncomfortable scenes that make you question their choices. Shame on them for delivering such a poorly written script, leading to an overall disappointing and regrettable cinematic experience."
"Anyone But You","barbett-1","1 January 2024",510,"Neither brilliant nor dreadful, ""Anyone But You"" features a cast of characters that are unbelievably attractive and, apparently, insanely wealthy. It stars Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeny's breasts in the formulatic equivalent of a Hallmark Movie knock-off. You know the drill - two perfect young people meet, are instantly attracted to each other, are separated by a misunderstanding with hilarious hijinks ensuing. The misunderstanding is eventually resolved, love blooms once more, and all ends well.What sets this film apart is excellent cinematography with lovely wide-angle views of the Australian countryside. The supporting cast is very capable although the Australian men are played as oafish stereotypes. Glen Powell plays his part well, but Sydney Sweeny appears to be reading her lines from a teleprompter offscreen. Not the worst movie out this holiday season and enjoyable as long as you refrain from high expectations."
"Anyone But You","pkertes-59666","5 January 2024",410,"I went to see this movie because I am a sucker for a romantic comedy, even the average ones (and let's face it, most of them are). Having seen the trailer, I had low expectations, yet this film still managed to come it at an even lower level.Boy meets girl, they hit it off briefly, there is a misunderstanding and when they reconnect through a friend/family wedding, they hate each other. Except as anyone could predict, ultimately they don't really, but it takes an eternity of inauthentic, puerile dross to get there. No tissues needed here.The acting is generally average to poor, and local actors like Rachel Griffiths and Bryan Brown (much of it filmed in Australia) do the minimum required, and are completely wasted here. The script is juvenile, facile and has little in common with reality. The direction is pedestrian and much of the movie is a travel ad for Sydney. Throw in plastic, unlikeable characters and a healthy dose of gratuitous nudity. The attempts at comedy are almost laughable as that, and what little romance eventuates at the end fails to convince after nearly two hours of tripe beforehand.Not recommended, even if you are a fan of the genre."
"Anyone But You","trinaboice","8 January 2024",410,"IN A NUTSHELL:
After an amazing first date, Bea and Ben's fiery attraction turns ice-cold until they find themselves unexpectedly reunited at a destination wedding in Australia that their exes also attend. So, they do what any two mature adults would do: pretend to be a couple amidst the fighting.The film was directed by Will Gluck, who also wrote it with Ilana Wolpert.Ultimately, this is like a rated R Hallmark movie with lots of raunch.THINGS I LIKED:
There is plenty of eye candy here for everyone. The cast is filled with good-looking people and includes Sydney Sweeney, Glen Powell, Alexandra Shipp, Hadley Robinson, GaTa, Michelle Hurd, Dermot Mulroney, Rachel Griffiths, Bryan Brown, and more.Sydney Sweeney was bit by a spider in the movie while filming. That famous clip was posted online and got a lot of stir.We get to visit Australia during the film.The cast is diverse, offering a variety of stories about romance and love.The last scene takes clips from the whole movie and has all of the actors sing the same song for a feel-good moment.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Sure, everyone in the cast is hot, but the script is garbage. It sounded like it was written by a trashy version of Chat GPT.It's supposed to be funny, but it's pathetic how they are instantly super ugly and mean-spirited to each other when they have a miscommunication.It's SUPER predictable.Cliched end-of-movie singing, dancing scene.So much fighting.So many awkward moments.They say the movie is loosely based on Shakepeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"", but I think the Bard would be disgusted by the lack of intelligent language in the script. So many F-bombs. One similarity is that they get a wedding cake from a shop called ""Dogberry's"", which is the name of a character in the play.I cringed and rolled my eyes so many times.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
This movie is definitely not appropriate for kids. It portrays unhealthy relationships and extremely bad behavior.Kids will be completely bored because it's mostly adults talking to each other.Profanity and lots of F-bombs
A lesbian couple kisses and gets married
We see a topless woman
We see several shirtless men
A couple gropes each other inside their shorts.Two women wear bikini tops that barely cover anything.We see a ton of cleavage
A lot of sexual innuendo. We see an unmarried couple in the shower and bed together.We see two men smoke a joint.!"
"Anyone But You","ambusched94","31 December 2023",210,"A forgettable, expendable rom-com where all the somewhat funny, shock value scenes are exposed in the theatrical trailer and there is hardly any laugh-out-loud scenes in this film overall.While Glen Powell has the comedy chops and romantic charm for this film genre, to my astonishment it's the EXACT OPPOSITE for Sydney Sweeney. Her line delivery is dull and she has the same facial expressions, blank stare, dead eyes for most scenes in Anyone But You. You can tell she's acting as in she's not embodying the character in the story and she's simply reading the lines, not conveying any natural nuances in her character each time she does this. Sweeney's crying scene in the taxi felt unnaturally forced. I was surprised her acting was half-a**ed, whereas in the TV series Euphoria (2019-present) her acting feels natural. Or highly likely that she's a limited-range, one-note actress that can only do dark, coming-of-age drama genre and fails at rom-com. IMO, Powell and Sweeney had the most chemistry when their characters were arguing and hating each other. When they got all lovey dovey, the on-screen chemistry felt forced and it was lacking that romantic spark between their characters. I was not invested enough in their progressing relationship to care once they officially got together in the end.So one, I feel like Sweeney largely ruins the film with her bland acting and line delivery, and lack of emotiveness. A better choice for the lead actress in this film should've been a comedic actress or an actress who can deftly juggle comedic timing and dramatic, emotional scenes. If this film was made and released in the 2000s decade for example, Amanda Bynes would be a prime choice for the role of Bea. And two, the character development is lacking and backstory are just tacked-on but don't add any characterization substance. The screenplay pushes the two characters to meet instantaneously at the start of the film, so viewers don't get any individual scenes of each lead character beforehand leaving a lot of character backstory nonexistent. The screenplay gives a brief overlay of each of Ben's and Bea's backstory in a scene montage and it's the error of telling over showing, and it doesn't work, leaving a rushed characterization of both characters that cheapens the film.Supporting characters feel like caricatures and don't add anything to the story. No supporting character was memorable. Some corny dialogue and meta rom-com instances that seem shoehorned in. Also, I wish Darren Barnet (Paxton from the TV series Never Have I Ever (2020-2023)) had more scenes, dialogue and that he would've been the guy Bea ended up with if there was an unexpected surprise, twist ending, instead of the ""enemies to lovers"" and ""stuck together so they'll end up together"" overused romance tropes. But the screenplay is too safe and screenwriters would never be bold enough to rise up to a different, atypical ending like this.I did like that the majority of the film was set in Australia and a few of the songs used in the film's soundtrack.It's ironic that Dermot Mulroney and Rachel Griffiths are in this sucky rom-com when blasting back to the past to 1997, both Mulroney (as the leading man and love interest) and Griffiths (in a supporting role) starred in a first rate quality rom-com, My Best Friend's Wedding. This is why most of my fave rom-coms are from the '90s and the 2000s. When quality storytelling, chemistry, and character development reigned in comparison to this current rom-com garbage.Anyone But You is a derivative, formulaic rom-com that's ultimately unmemorable, vapid rom-com plot, and a waste of time. Just casually watch it once it comes out on streaming if you have nothing else to watch and don't care about draining 1 hour 43 minutes of your time."
"Anyone But You","dogonlion","10 February 2024",110,"Everything in this movie feels forced. The comedy is like ""please laugh, please laugh"". I guess that works on some. Nothing flows naturally. The way they love at first sight and all of the sudden start bickering is unrealistic. The bickering is annoying. Sydney Sweeney is a really good actress, I really liked her in The White Lotus, but she's hasn't been in a movie that uses her full potential yet. The movie is full of cliches. It even has the funny black friend with no love life. I'm really shocked by how much money this movie made.

It had some cute scenes. I gotta say the ensemble was pretty good if I laughed it was always because something one of them said. They were a bunch of goofy characters. I also enjoyed dermot mulroney's character when he was learning how to dive and the reoccurance of that at the end of the movie.

"Anyone But You","masonsaul","30 December 2023",710,"Anyone But You is an enjoyably cynical rom com that still has plenty of heartfelt romance at its centre. Just getting one of these theatrically released currently is kind of a miracle and it plays squarely to the genre's strengths. All its beats are predictable in the best way.Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell are on their way to becoming genuine movie stars and this film only further solidifies that. The constant barbs they send each other's way for the majority of the film are really funny and the chemistry they're constantly trying to deny has a real spark to it.This isn't Will Gluck's first rom com and that's apparent in the good ways. The broad physical comedy is balanced nicely by the snappy wit interspersed throughout and it's surprisingly epic (a lot more helicopter stuff than expected). A good soundtrack always helps with this genre and the one here nails it."

I went with my adult children and we all loved the movie. My kids make fun of my love for Hallmark movies, but even they liked this one. We laughed out loud repeatedly and walked out smiling. I love that feeling.Sure, the script is flawed, the plot's ridiculous, and some of the dialogue is a bit off, but Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney light up the screen with their amazing chemistry. They're extraordinary specimens and look like they spend 6 hours a day in the gym, but I also like them as actors. Glen Powell was really good in another enjoyable modern rom-com with Zoey Deutch called ""Set It Up"" and he's fearless here, especially with the over the top body humor.Sydney Sweeney is certainly voluptuous, and gorgeous to look at, but she's also established herself as a great actress in more critic friendly shows like ""Euphoria"" and ""White Lotus"". Edgy and dark is fine, and it certainly gets taken more seriously by the critics, but I prefer getting lost in an escapist rom-com that doesn't involve terrible people doing terrible things.I want more of this."

"Anyone But You","NatKaminska","28 December 2023",110,"I need to warn those of you who want to spend your money on this thing: don't do it, not worth it. I watched the movie and it was horrible. It tried to be a charming '90s and '2000s rom-com, yet it failed in every department except with the male lead. Glen Powell is the only good thing about this movie.'Anyone but you' is full of cliches and while you can do cliches in a good way, and make genuine, great gem of a specific genre, this is not the case here. The movie is boring, shallow, cringe comedy with typical cringe, over-the-top, not-funny jokes, maybe 1 joke lands in the entire movie, that's how bad it is. The supposedly 'hilarious' nude scene on the cliff, especially the part when Powell is bending over, completely naked, holding his balls in his hands, is the next level of cringe, nothing funny, nothing charming, just cringe, awkward, awful. It's also full of heavy, not subtle, and obvious cultural references as if the writers just wrote down popular internet memes. Man, these writers really don't have any respect for the viewers. I basically wanted to walk out of this movie after the first 15 minutes.The romance part is badly done as well. The chemistry is average at best, just like a normal chemistry between two beautiful people - they are easy on the eyes oh right, like most people in this industry, but nothing more. They are not Mulder and Scully or Hanks and Ryan. Another problem with the main couple is that only Powell is to some degree likable, even tho the script doesn't make his character particularly likable, Powell's natural charisma and charm do the trick. With Sweeney that doesn't exist, she is utterly unlikeable as Bea, and this flaw kills the romance and fun completely. Despite what was said about this duo during the last summer and what some of their blind stans and the media still say now, they don't fit together as a rom-com couple at all!The screenplay itself doesn't help the actors achieve any chemistry, as the entire story is incredibly predictable, and thus boring, with awful dialogues and wooden acting most of the time.Nothing really happens in this movie! Any romantic comedy has to have some stakes in the relationship, some solid drama, and funny, unexpected twists and turns that make sense at least in the fictional universe. In this movie, the conflict that starts Ben and Bea's feud doesn't even make sense! Literally, one minute of simple explanation would clear the air between them, as they are visibly attracted to each other, from the first moment they meet. So the whole basis of this film, that they hate each other, doesn't make sense. We needed some stronger reason for the hate here.Yes, I'm aware that this movie is based on Shakespeare's play 'Much Ado About Nothing', and that one point of that play is that a great fuss/drama between the protagonists started from something insignificant ('nothing'), but every artist, and not only an artist but average person, knows that film is a completely different medium than a theater play, and what worked in a play about romance, written in Shakespeare's times, doesn't work as well in a modern, romantic comedy film. This movie isn't written intelligently enough to make it work either. Again, for the plot to be compelling in this film, we needed a stronger reason for hatred between the main characters, and the development of the characters, and we got neither of those things. Throughout the film, the characters are basic sketches, and we don't know much about them till the end.Then, during the next two, remaining acts of the movie, also nothing really happens. They decide to fake that they are together out of the blue, and their reasons for it are also simply not good enough for the audience to care about the characters and the story. Throughout the entire film, we don't see at all that Ben genuinely desires his ex, and Bea's parents don't have enough of the presence, are completely flat, insignificant characters for the audience to believe or care that she needs to lie to them, which were the two main reasons for the masquerade. Therefore, another giant flaw of the script: the motivations of the main characters that are supposed to push the plot forward are insufficient to be credible and interesting to the audience.In general, the problem is that nothing is fleshed out in 'Anyone but You' - not the main storyline, not the two main leads, not the background characters, drama, or comedy.The 'meta' lines in the script, the kinda 'wink- wink we know it's typical rom-com trope' also don't work because for this to work, the entire script would have to be much more intelligent and satirical, and it isn't smart or a satire at all! It just tried to cheat the audience by doing this, or the writers gave themselves an easy excuse for the rest of their bad writing, and again - it doesn't work. Nothing works in this movie.Yet another big problem: Sydney doesn't have a talent for comedy, sorry. Her delivery is very bland and too stiff, her character is flat, like cut out of a cardboard figure. I just don't understand how someone like her could get the role specifically in romantic comedy if she doesn't fit this role at all. Weren't there some other, better, and actually comedy-talented, cute actresses available during the casting process? Or was it just an easy money grab because it is Sydney Sweeney from 'Euphoria'?Glen is the only one who can be genuinely hilarious and gives his all, and that is not a surprise for anyone who follows his career. Glen already showed his comedy talent in Scream Queens but also proved it as Hangman in Top Gun. He is a very funny guy in real life too, as you can see in his interviews, so it's obvious comedy is natural for him. That's why he absolutely is in his element in this movie, and he 'feels it' but the problem is no one of the rest of the cast is, including Sydney. And Glen alone is still not good enough to save this movie.When you have such a difference in comedic chops between two leads in a romantic comedy that is a giant problem. I don't know if you noticed, but the hilarious thing is, you can already see in the trailers, that Sydney is not good at all in this movie. I remember that I commented her delivery is terrible the minute I watched the trailer!After I watched this movie, I definitely think Glen is much better in romantic comedies when paired with Zoey Deutch. Glen has a way better, more organic, and natural chemistry with Zoey than with Sydney, maybe because Zoey has a comedy talent just like Glen. I saw on Glen's IMDB that he is going to star in another comedy with Zoey, hopefully, better written than this one, so I will wait for it.To sum up, 'Anyone but You' is not worth one second of your time, your money, or any buzz, just wait for the the movie to appear on the streaming platforms. It doesn't have the great main couple, it doesn't have good background characters, it doesn't have the charm, wit, and natural flow that romantic comedies of the '90s or early '2000 had, like She's All That, Love Actually, Holiday, 10 Things I Hate About You, or How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.It simply doesn't have good or even decent writing! And I'm not the enemy of romantic comedies, I'm a woman and aspiring filmmaker, I love great romantic comedies just like any other great movie, of any other genre. But this movie is so bad, that I genuinely felt ashamed while watching it - I felt ashamed for the filmmakers who made this, especially the writers. Don't bother!"
"Anyone But You","SnoopyStyle","24 February 2024",610,"Bea (Sydney Sweeney) meets Ben (Glen Powell) in a coffee shop and they hook up. There are misunderstandings next morning and they leave angry. It turns out that his friend is marrying her sister. The two enemies have to attend a destination wedding in Australia.Sweeney and Powell are trying all kind of broad physical humor. They are both gorgeous and both have good charisma. Neither are outright comedians and that is important. They are mildly funny but are rarely the funniest part. The first big laugh is the WTF old guy while the two bicker. The butt grabbing scene kinda works, but the leads may be overshadowed by a koala. This duo tries very hard. It's so ridiculous that it's mildly funny."
"Anyone But You","johnnymonsarrat","3 February 2024",410,"Hello again, fellow film travelers.I have to wonder what happened to the writing of this movie. There are some interesting and touching twists to the plot. But mainly it seems plot driven, not character driven. Characters don't make consistent choices with their personality or logic, for example what happens with the parents at the end.The male lead has an acting style that's full of confidence, but he's supposed to be a comic figure that has disabling phobias. God knows why he can barely swim but he can teach diving.The female lead, I take no pleasure in saying this, tends to speak at the other actors instead of to them.I get that the writers were trying to go for a Shakespeare type of thing, like Much Ado About Nothing, but the movie simply wasn't comedic enough to have unconvincing character choices. You can get away with a lot of goofy stuff in a slapstick comedy. But this had mostly drama. So the characters need to make sense.I am sorry. I really wanted to like this.There were hints of genius. There was some good physical comedy and a few touchimg moments. But the cringe worthy flaws buried them."
"Anyone But You","gerrgrady-86307","27 December 2023",210,"My husband and I chose this movie as a Saturday treat. We left around the halfway mark because I kept hoping that it would improve - a waste of time & our weekly movie budget. The actors were given dialog that was juvenile and scene set-ups that were embarrassing. Lots of gratitious nudity and shots of partial nudity. Anyone interested in seeing this movie should just watch the trailer - it gives viewers a good picture of what they'll see at the theater so they don't waste their time sitting through a really bad movie. It was great seeing Bryan Brown but I wish he had chosen a better vehicle in which to appear than this dreck. I had greater expections for Glen Powell, but then maybe this is the level of his actual talent. Sad."
"Anyone But You","DeanAmythe","4 January 2024",410,"Never been into romcoms all that much (I watch movies alone all day as a true cinglephile), though I acknowledge their importance in filling the void for comfort watches: predictable, feel-good, and just the right amount of schmaltz - perfect for a night out (or in). Their template structure isn't so much a concern rather than an obstacle to overcome, which can be achieved with a fun gimmick of some sort, or, simply, by hitting the comedic marks. If this genre wants to see its resurgence these points are vital, and last year's NO HARD FEELINGS was eager to prove that, a return to form yet still raunchy and imbued with a surprising air of maturity - and even when the jokes didn't land, there was still enjoyment to be found in the excellent(ly cast) leads. ANYONE BUT YOU is as back-to-basics as it could get and appears to be, to a certain extent, aware of that, though here the drive to still be its own thing is completely absent. What immediately stands out is the central 'do-they, don't-they', which pretty much feeds directly into the classic plot structure and is barely taken advantage of. When it is being used for comedic purposes, it easily produces the highlights of the film, like the view/spider scene. Most of this, though, is by-the-numbers and safe, lacking any edge or remarkable features aside from the leads' sex appeal (on that front, the quality of the casting is equal to NO HARD FEELINGS). Speaking of them, Powell is as fun as expected - he would most likely be a solid movie star if the current Hollywood system allowed for those - but Sweeney? No clue what she's doing with those line reads, constantly sounding like a bad impression of an American high school girl with a ready disinterest in everything. Not that she has that much to work with anyway, as the script suffers from eye-rollers of jokes, that first half especially bursting with ""did I just say that out loud?"" humor. My sold out screening was awfully silent through most of this, though maybe they were just there for the aforementioned hotties. Just so you know: you don't get a (proper) view of Sweeney's melons, but you do get to see a squeezed Australian glans. 4/10."
"Anyone But You","jaynzsarah-561-359737","10 February 2024",110,"Launch a cannon to your head.This is one of the worst films I have ever had the misfortune to watch. I could feel my brain cells dying as I watched this absolute mess of a rom-com.Sydney Sweeney was horrible and has all but ruined her career. She could not make any part of her character believable. Very hard to watch.I'm embarrassed for Brian brown for having anything to do with this movie. He couldn't save this film from disaster.The script jumped all over the place and was so completely unrealistic... not once did the film make me believe any part of it could happen.The film relies on poor humour, And, what they don't show you in the commercials is that it's full of far-left LGBTQ propaganda.I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy."
"Anyone But You","ethanbresnett","6 January 2024",710,"Anyone But You caught me a little bit by surprise I must say. Perhaps that's because my expectations were quite low, but they really needn't have been as this film is a really solid romcom.Primarily this comes from Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney. A romcom lives and dies by its romantic leads, and they are both great in this, nailing the weird and evolving chemistry between their two characters. They are each decently well written, feeling believable and engaging.On top of this, there is a fairly forgettable but perfectly pleasant assortment of supporting characters who add some extra levels of humour to the piece.Speaking of humour, it is a bit hit and miss in this film. There aren't many big laughs, but it is amusing and does have a light and goofy tone throughout that is befitting of any romcom.Now, this film doesn't really reinvent the wheel in any way. It has all the same story beats as most romcoms and doesn't take too many risks. Therefore the plot is fairly mediocre and (as with practically all romcoms) is far too predictable. This never really gets in the way of the fun though, but the inevitable ending does make it feel a teensy bit too long.Overall though I think this is a really solid film. It has a good tone, a couple of engaging leads, and will give you a few laughs too."
"Anyone But You","tm-sheehan","5 January 2024",610,"My Review. Anyone But You
My Rating. 6:10Very very loosely based on Shakespeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"" with even a few quotations in the background and title cards this pleasant enough rom com reminds me of a line from a 16 th Century play The Merchant of Venice by same William Shakespeare, ""All that glisters is not gold"".Which of course translates in today's language ""All that glitters is not gold "".Anyone But You has a pleasant cast set in and around Sydney which is fun to spot locations like the QVB building, and our beautiful harbour vistas and pristine beaches.I was reminded of a far superior Classic romantic comedy ""My Best Friend's Wedding "" 1997 when I saw the actor playing the brides father Dermot Mulroney who achieved great success playing a similar lead 26 years ago to Glen Powell who plays Ben the romantic lead man in this movie.I enjoyed both the young leads Sydney Sweeney who plays Bea and Glen Powell who play the star crossed lovers .The differences and similarities for me in great romance comedies with weddings like My Best Friends Wedding and more recently Crazy Rich Asians is obvious they all look fabulous with surroundings that celebrate the affluence of wealthy privileged people .Where they differ from each other is in the quality of the script writing in this case by Ilana Wolpert and Will Gluck.Light comedy can be clever if it's not pretentious why try and improve on Shakespeare? It's an impossible task.Anyone But You is entertaining but parts of it I found really irritating and contrived.Adding a same sex wedding was a nice modern touch but it's the most heterosexual same sex wedding I've ever seen not one Gay in this village except Claudia and Halle the betrothed couple.The most irritating characters for me were the parents of the brides played by Dermot Mulroney, Rachel Griffiths, Bryan Brown and Michelle Hurd they all seemed to be trying to hard .I can't be to critical of this light comedy that probably appeals to a younger audience demographic than myself .I hope it succeeds overseas as we need to export more home grown cinema product from Australia but we can't just rely on great scenery and cute animal platitudes like winking koalas ."
"Anyone But You","psxexperten","9 February 2024",110,"Horrible, don't waste your time
Weak story, unnecessarily extensive vulgar language, and excessive nudity humiliates the actors. Embarrassing movie that degrades men and women and shows no imagination. It is very sad to believe that this movie appeals to people. Downright stupid with no redeeming qualities.I had respect for some of these actors before I watched this movie. All I can say is that perhaps they will do anything for money. I cannot see any other reason to have participated in this film and I am scared for any teenagers or young adults that are entertained by showing off your body and acting like adolescent fools."
"Anyone But You","movieman6-413-929510","5 January 2024",510,"Anyone But You is a new romantic comedy directed, written and produced in part by Will Gluck, director of Easy A and Friends with Benefits.Bea (Sydney Sweeney) and Ben (Glen Powell) haven't seen each other since a first date. When they are both invited to the same wedding, the two meet again.They learn that people are trying to hook them up so they don't cause further problems during the wedding. This is why they pretend, to get rid of the fuss.Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell have good chemistry together in the film and both know how to play well and playfully with and against each other. Despite their chemistry, the overall film is unfortunately more on the standard side of a romantic comedy. This gives the film game its well-known and predictable sides. Other moments come across as a bit too forced. For co-writer Ilana Wolpert, this is only her first written film story.Another downside of the film is the amount of extra characters. Many of these extras bring their own kind of comedy, but otherwise have little real use in the film. With a few fewer of these extras, the film could have been better focused, with a shorter running time."
"Anyone But You","marisol_fc","14 January 2024",110,"What a terrible movie, this reviews have to be fake because there's nothing above 1 star from thia movie.Story is just plain dumb, acting is DEPLORABLE, no wonder they had reshoots, they probably saw the finished product and they said This is beyond bad, and decided if Sydney can't act at least but more boobs and more body asap! Maybe will distract people from her weird acting and that strange way of talking like she has something lodged on her cheeks.Dont waste your money or time in this , go do laundry or try to make that recipe you saved from tik tok.There is a reason they were trying so hard with the promo, EVERYBODY KNEW IT WAS A FLOP."
"Anyone But You","alyetc","28 December 2023",510,"We've seen a million movies set at weddings before - where even the couple getting married gets invested in the main couples status. So I knew a lot of the tropes would be the same, but it was the same but a bit worse. The main couple story I actually really liked, I thought they were hilarious and cute and beat out other movies with the same storyline. It was everything else that fell short. The background characters felt cheesy and fake. All surface level gags or you didn't really get to know them, nothing felt genuine - case in point Bea's parents were incredibly unrealistic, no ones that out of touch. Even Bea's background felt half-done, never explaining why she didn't want law school."
"Anyone But You","STARONTHETOPOFTHESKY","11 February 2024",110,"The movie, unfortunately, failed to deliver on multiple fronts. Its repetitive and cliché romantic comedy storyline lacked originality, leaving the audience unengaged. The attempts at humor fell flat, resulting in a tedious and cringe-worthy viewing experience. To add to the disappointment, the lead actress's annoying voice only added to the overall lackluster quality of the film, making it a forgettable and uninspiring cinematic endeavor. Terrible acting and story. I don't understand the high rating of this movie, or the hype. Save your time and skip this one. The movie is downright horrible, with uncomfortable scenes that make you question their choices. Shame on them for delivering such a poorly written script, leading to an overall disappointing and regrettable cinematic experience."
