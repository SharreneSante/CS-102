"The Beekeeper","DocteurDream","30 January 2024",NA,"Verona Parker is easily one of the worst characters ever written for the screen, takes away everything this movie aspires to be. The actress also did a piss poor job and always had me cringing at the unrealistic and unreasonable choices she makes. If you'd delete that character entirely, this movie would've been a whole lot better in the long run.Subject wise it's a very nice concept of a revenge thriller against scam call centers- but again, the whole govt mumbo jumbo makes it feel a whole run of the mill action BS from Hollywood mid tier movies. If the story had been awhole lot grounded, it would've done a whole lot better imo."
"The Beekeeper","kjproulx","12 January 2024",NA,"By now, audiences should realize what they are in for when it comes to Jason Statham leading an action film. The Beekeeper is the latest film to continue his long-running legacy of action flicks and it's quite a bit of fun. It's very far from an awards nominee, but for a film I had zero expectations for, and for being as cheesy as it is, it's pretty good. Take that as you will because I will be diving into things that are also pretty bad as well. The cheesiness of this film will turn some people off, but I was able to ignore it. Here's why I recommend The Beekeeper if you want to watch a new action-packed film to enjoy and not have to think too much about.The ""Beekeepers"" is an organization of hitmen who take out criminals. Jason Statham plays Adam Clay, a retiree from this organization, who is on a manhunt for everyone involved in scamming a woman he cared for, which led to her suicide. It's as simple as that. There are multiple bosses in this company, so it's like watching a sophisticated video game being played out. The action sequences are well-choreographed and there are quite a few action scenes, so overall, this film was a blast to watch. With that said, the dialogue from beginning to end it pretty atrocious.If the script had been reworked, I think this could've been a surprisingly great film as a whole. Sadly, the dialogue is full of Bee puns that fall flat almost every time, even with solid actors delivering them. The character arc and dialogue for Josh Hutcherson's Derek Danforth (who is the main villain of the film) is laughable, and not really in a good way. His whiny, self-entitled performance was great and I liked that he was giving this character his all, it's just that, again, the dialogue sucks. The lines everyone was saying took me out of the experience many times. Still, there is a lot of great action, and that's what I wanted from a movie like this anyway. I'm sure the dialogue will have people hating this movie and I'm equally sure certain people will find it hilarious. I'm kind of in the middle.The Beekeeper is David Ayer's latest directorial effort and as always, he does a great job with action. His touch as a director is always welcomed by me and the neon look to the film was cool as well. It's a cool film to watch and it's aesthetically pleasing. I may be ripping apart the script, but it's just the dialogue. The story itself plays out nicely and has a nice resolution. I was looking for a fun action film and this film delivered that, despite its downfalls. I say check it out."
"The Beekeeper","FeastMode","12 January 2024",NA,"I seem to use that headline a lot. I guess it's better than a bad movie with bad fight scenes.Starting with the good, Statham is awesome as usual. And I loved all of the fight scenes. They are ridiculously fast yet completely clear. It's hard hitting, you can feel the blows. This is enhanced by the beastly IMAX speakers. And with the R-rating, it doesn't hold back. Although it's far from gratuitous.The bad? Sigh. The non-action scenes, which make up the majority of the movie, range from average to terrible. The quality level feels like a streaming movie, not a theatrical one. I spent much of the runtime uninterested and unengaged.Everything feels off. The dialogue is weird. The acting is questionable. And there are a bunch of dumb things that strain believability. Like the entire bad guy organization. Or a laugh-out-loud idiotic character decision during the climax. A true ""are you kidding me?"" moment.Even the cut to credits felt odd. Like the director just cut in the middle of a shot and said, ""screw it, let's go home.""(1 viewing, early screening UltraScreen 1/6/2024)"
"The Beekeeper","Neptune165","2 February 2024",NA,"Just when you think we have reached the bottom of filmmaking ... there is always something like this flick just to prove you can do a lot worse! It s so bland. The FBI agent was not professional and dressed and sounded dumb, lost mom by suicidal act and that did not play much of a roll after the incident,, the villains sounded stupid, especially the dip shots from the call centers. The story idea was great, Jason was awesome but the rest of the actors failed to bring it home. This movie is a terrible revenge story. The idea that Beekeepers are the most elite, well-trained, best equipped one man army is so over-used. The most unbelievable part is that he is hunted by mercenaries, law enforcement, and other Beekeepers. The acting is terrible, the storyline is worse."
"The Beekeeper","BA_Harrison","12 January 2024",NA,"After Fast X and The Meg 2, I swore I wouldn't waste any more of my time on Jason Statham movies, but the trailer for The Beekeeper looked good, so I thought I would give him one last chance. I just hoped that I wouldn't get stung again.Thankfully, this action flick from director David Ayer is as sweet as honey: it's unpretentious, over-the-top, gloriously violent nonsense that isn't to be taken seriously... the film is all about how many people the star can kill or maim during the 1hr 45minute runtime (the answer: a lot!).Statham plays Adam Clay, a beekeeper in more ways than one: he looks after bee hives on the farm owned by kindly Eloise Parker (Phylicia Rashad), but he's also a retired special operative known as a 'beekeeper', part of a government programme so secret even the FBI doesn't know about it. When Eloise loses all of her savings to scammers and commits suicide, Adam isn't a happy man and goes after those responsible, the trail leading all the way to the President of the United States (Jemma Redgrave).Buildings are blown up, limbs are broken, body parts are severed, people are shot, but Adam barely gets a scratch -- those looking for realism should look elsewhere. There's even a scene where a female beekeeper uses a mini-gun mounted on the back of a truck, and mini-guns always equal fun.At the end of the day, Adam makes the bad guys pay for their crimes, and promptly escapes, presumably to set up some more bee hives (the villains having shot up his earlier ones) and to prepare for the inevitable sequel."
"The Beekeeper","imseeg","12 January 2024",NA,"I was excited to see a new action movie with Jason Statham (one of my favorite ACTION actors) and although his figting scenes are still okay (ish), they weren't exhilirating. But there is something worse...The bad: Jason Statham (although in a leading role) doesnt get much screen time. A lot of the time we ONLY get to see a bunch of bland FBI agents, who arent impressing me in any way with their subpar acting performances.Nor do these FBI agents come across as credible by the way, constantly missing Jason Statham when they have all the time and opportunity to kill him point blank. Quite silly.More bad: the other supporting actors are really bad though, But they (AS WELL) do get a lot of screentime. So annoying.Not any good? Actor Jeremy Irons nails it. He plays the role of a cunning sophisticated bad guy and he is terrific. But what the heck is the distinguished and superb actor Jeremy Irons doing in such a cheap looking action movie? HE is the only redeeming feature of this movie though, besides a few action scenes with Jason Statham.Jason Statham fans beware, this one is quite a dud. Tedious, lame, uneventful."
"The Beekeeper","Xavier_Stone","10 January 2024",NA,"Written by Kurt Wimmer who is known for The Expendables which seems about right. Nearly all action which was ok, yet the story is just trash. If you're a fan of Jason then this one is just another average film with his stunts and fighting.Other than that the movie lacks any seriousness and the law enforcement roles are comical and everyone just comes out looking like keystone cops. It could have been so much better with a decent director and a lot of tweaks in the script.Sadly, not enough going on here to please anything but the Jason fans. 3 stars for action, zero for everything else. Even the ending is a zero. Park your brain before watching, no thinking required."
"The Beekeeper","martinrobertson300482","28 January 2024",NA,"Not sure why i went to see this one as i've not seen most of Jason Stathams movies. And if they're anything like this one i won't be in a rush to revisit them.The movie looked dumb, and it is. Statham is a beekeeper. Both metaphorically and genuinely. Infact the worst part of the film isn't how repetitive and boring the action gets (where Statham is practically untouchable). But the cringey push to make ex-military beekeeper tough guys a thing. You'll definitely get some laughs from how ridiculous it all is. But half the time I couldn't really tell if they were intentional laughs or not.I guess there is enough decent action. Like the farm scene, the middle office attack, and there's a decent brutal fight scene near the end. But even the most promising part of the movie - setting up the great villian for a well deserved ass kicking later. Doesn't pay off. So overall, pretty poor."
"The Beekeeper","banzoozalreviews","12 January 2024",NA,"David Ayer's ""The Beekeeper"" has Jason Statham going full John Wick and full Equalizer. This movie is 90 odd minutes of relentless, unhinged, pure escapist fun, with Statham doing what he does best - taking out bad guys like it's nothing and looking uber cool while doing it. He does that here in spades, in the most brutal and ridiculously entertaining ways. Yes, you need to throw believability aside, but if you are a fan of 80s and 90s action thrillers where it's one man against all, you will love this, just like I did. This movie really was a blast and a half, and then some. A great way to start 2024 movie season. I loved it. Pure escapist entertainment."
"The Beekeeper","kuner-59029","14 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper attempts to copy the John Wick formula to the point of plagiarism.The setup is virtually the same. Statham, playing himself as usual, is retired and extremely dangerous ex-assassin, member of a secret group called ""Beekeepers"". He get pulled out of retirement over a seemingly minor incident, and the conflict escalates.A woman he sells honey to (played by the mom from the Cosby Show) commits suicide after having her savings stolen by a scammer company.He takes revenge for her, but oh no, the company belongs to the president's no-good son (similar to the Russian Mob boss's son in the John Wick original).He fights his way to the top through many neon-lit setpieces until he reaches the final boss. The end.However, unlike John Wick, there is none of the fascinating world building, none of the flair, none of the great music editing, much of the acting is awful, and so the whole thing comes apart at the seams. Tonally, the film never hits the mark. Scenes variate between overacted and ridiculous to boring, slow paced and TV series like. Every time the narrative switches to a female FBI agent, the air is sucked out of the movie, and energy comes to a grinding halt.The use of music is awful. It alternates between Batman knock off cello and contrabass strings, which don't fit at all, to house and electronic in scenes where it doesn't fit either. It worked in John Wick, because it was woven into the story. John Wick was either in a night club, or the music was played on the Assassin's radio station. Here it just comes out of nowhere.There are a few good kills. The car off the drawbridge early on is excellent. The final boss fight was decent, but not over the top enough to be memorable.Overall, this is a poorly made film that you will forget the moment you finish it. It's barely watchable, but I deducted points for plagiarism."
"The Beekeeper","sbweightman","12 January 2024",NA,"A really enjoyable revenge action film full of fast paced action and corny bee-related dialogue. Although the character's backstory has been done many times before, the plot has some modern ideas and modern villains which are easy to hate and the strong moral message was quite refreshing. Good acting from a good cast of characters and whilst some of the henchmen are a bit silly, their larger than life presence adds some surprises into what is otherwise pretty standard fare. Good pacing, music and fight scenes keep it entertaining throughout, although the start is pretty slow and the ending rather abrupt."
"The Beekeeper","olcare","10 January 2024",NA,"I mean, I don't know what to say; it feels like the movie's script was randomly written without any thought. The events are so poorly explained that I couldn't believe it while watching. I have no idea how they shot it. I'm addressing everyone who watched and gave good ratings: watch it again, life is not that simple.I want to mention Jason Statham. The only good thing in the movie is Jason. He is more than an actor; he's an excellent athlete, continuing this for years and elevating all the action scenes in every action movie. In some fight scenes in this film, extras stand there taking hits flatly, and it's entirely the fault of those who planned the scenes.There's no recognizable plot; the character just walks straight into the president of some made-up country's house, kills 30 people, and we watch this for 1 hour and 40 minutes. The FBI is portrayed as if it's a village organization; the detectives hang out like it's their dad's farm. It's unbelievable. They wrote a movie without sitting down and thinking about these details; it's astonishing.The Beekeeper program is constantly mentioned in the film, but what is it? What do these people do? How were they trained? What hardships did they endure? None of it is there; they just expect us to believe in a name. There's nothing about how the top-secret deadly agents of the government are trained.Money theft and the presidential race are portrayed like child's play. These are not people you can easily reach; to blow up a building or enter the president's mansion, you need an incredibly good script, and this film has none of that.The acting is also bad, except for Jason Statham. There's no good performance except him. The character's motivation is bad too; killing 100 people because a woman who treated him well while beekeeping shot herself. We should have seen a 3-5 minute segment about their intimacy.I don't know what else to say; it just goes on and on, complete bulls**t. I'm thinking about David Ayer's early works, and nowadays, each film he makes is dragging everything further down. The screenwriter, Kurt Wimmer, has also messed up; he wrote it thoughtlessly. I'm eagerly anticipating the film's complete failure at the box office. Definitely a waste of time.."
"The Beekeeper","UniqueParticle","11 January 2024",NA,"So glad I got to see an early screening in imax on 1-6-24 just couldn't review yet. Anyway such an enriching thrill ride to satisfy any action fan of badass one man army types kinda like John Wick with a different style to it! I've been a fan of Jason Statham for a couple decades now and this is one of his best. The writing is magnificent too Kurt Whimmer is perfect for in depth action extravaganza.For an autistic person that's been scammed numerous times Beekeeper hit the spot; I absolutely loved the way everything played out. Well directed, crystal smooth writing, amazing story and top notch action; highly recommend I'll definitely want to own in 4K!"
"The Beekeeper","dam-24421","31 January 2024",NA,"They forgot to write a script? Or bring their head along in this movie?Nothing seemed to work, acting, storyline, everything was so rushed. The actors were incredibly bad, especially Parker. That must be some of the most cringe, b acting I have ever seen. It was unwatchable, I stayed in the cinema because I had my little brother with me, and wouldn't be rude and interfere with the other people in the cinema.This movies gets -3/10Way too cheesy and cringe. David Ayer this is a redo, better luck next time. My sincere condolences for the people watching.Just another movie for the money, so sad."
"The Beekeeper","petercarlsson-92297","30 January 2024",NA,"Jason Statham does the same movie - again - that he's been doing the last 20 years. This time without a script. They just stacked a number of fight and action scenes on top of each other, then called it a movie.Statham has done a few rather good movies like this. For example ""Homefront"". That movie had a script and good acting. But this... What is this? Is it made for teenage boys? For adults? For girls? Boys? I don't know, but the result is nothing new, nothing thrilling and nothing fun.So what do we got. Well, that's a really good question. The problem is that there's very, very hard to find a good answer."
"The Beekeeper","Brillfury","13 January 2024",NA,"Look,I love a good action flick as much as anyone, and Jason Statham is usually awesome. But sadly director David Ayer delivers what will probably be one of the worst movies of 2024. Ayer made one great movie over 20 years ago (Training Day) and also delivered a good flick in Fury, but everything else he makes is horrible. I will admit I did get a kick out of how dumb and goofy this movie is, and laughed a lot. Statham's character is like a cardboard box, it's so boring. Yes his fighting scenes are very cool but he's played awesome characters before that also had a bit of kick. In this movie he gives us nothing.Phylicia Rashad looks fabulous and gets about 5 minutes of screen time. Jeremy Irons and Josh Hutcherson do a great job but their talents are wasted in this movie.The plot starts out really promising...who wouldn't love to see a revenge action movie where the evil call centers get justice? But sadly the premise is wasted.Oh if you love hearing the word ""Beekeeper"" and references to bees you'll love this.The dialogue in this movie is so corny. It's almost like a satire of action movies at some points.In David Ayer's world, nothing works like it actually does in the real world. It is so goofy the way he portrays everything. And this is something he does in a lot of his movies. Just dumb fictional versions of everything from presidents to agencies to how classified programs work. But I do understand they have to make movies and sometimes make everything really stupid to be entertaining. But this movie takes the cake. For instance, call center scams are a real thing and there are many YouTube videos showing how they operate. But in this movie, the call center office is the most over the top clown spectacle you'll ever see and the actual scam is a ludicrous fictionalized version of how they actually work.The two main FBI agents are portrayed goofy AF and their dialogue is nearly unbearable.Statham's character, the beekeeper, doesn't want you to steal from old people but he has no qualms with murdering about 50 federal law enforcement officers in the course of the movie without batting an eye.So if you are about 13 years old this movie will be the coolest thing you've seen but anywhere over that and it's just too dumb. Maybe when it's on streaming it might be fun to watch and make fun of on a rainy day."
"The Beekeeper","TheNamelessCzar","27 January 2024",NA,"This may be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in the theater. I should've known better knowing I was going to see a Jason Statham movie. He has no talent, and he simply is known for his name and his action/fighting skills. But the reviews were so good! Apparently, the reviewers were paid off. The plot is ridiculous, and the acting skills were as bad as a high school drama club,. At times, I felt like I was watching ann episode of NOVA learning all sorts of things about bees. Statham has one facial expression in the movie, and it looks like boredom. Never again will I see on of his movie sin the theater... I'll wait to bore myself at home when it comes on streaming instead."
"The Beekeeper","masonsaul","13 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper isn't as tight or condensed as the films it borrows from thanks to an unexpectedly dense mythology but it really delivers where it counts. It's essentially Jason Statham beating people up for 100 minutes and it never gets old. Thankfully it doesn't really sequel bait however more of these would definitely be welcome.Jason Statham is never bad even when he's in a dud like a few of his recent films. Even so, it's nice to see his talent and physicality employed in something actually good. Jeremy Irons has the ability to deliver exposition about beekeeping in an engaging manner and Josh Hutcherson is actually awake for this one.Similarly to Statham, David Ayer has had a few misses so it's equally rewarding to see him back doing what he knows best whilst showing he and his team are really good at hand to hand combat. The score by David Sardy & Jared Michael Fry is a huge part of why this works, treating the dumbest twists with the utmost seriousness."
"The Beekeeper","masonfisk","30 January 2024",NA,"The first film of the year may rank as one of the worst for the same as Jason Statham kicks butts & takes names (or is it the other way around?) in this goofy revenge tale. Statham, a former government operative, has retired plying his trade running an apiary on a retired woman's property, Phylicia Rashad, but after she commits suicide after being ripped off by some internet sharks prompting Statham to spew bad bee puns while he kills his way to the top (or bottom, these people are scum!) in a concern which runs right to the heights of the White House as the president's, Gemma Redgrave, (from Howard's End) son, played by Josh Hutcherson, is raking in millions from duped customers which will not stand as far as Statham is concerned. David Ayer, a mismatched director for this material (was Shane Black busy?), directs a particularly goofy premise from scenarist David Wimmer, does not help a whit w/humorless Statham doing the physical lifting w/o any issues but the unintentional guffaws generated from villains who look like extras from The Terminator's Tech-noir dance club scene makes this memorable outing for the wrong reasons. Also starring Oscar winner Jeremy Irons as Redgrave's handler, Oscar nominee Minnie Driver (wasted frankly!) as a government contact & Emmy Raver-Lampman (from The Umbrella Academy) who plays Rashad's daughter."
"The Beekeeper","timeblank","21 January 2024",NA,"I fell victim to a scam, and it's satisfying to see scammers getting their due in the Beekeeper movie. Jason Statham's action-packed destruction of the building and culprits is glorious. Despite the absurd plot, the theme of justice prevails. The constant investigation of Statham's crimes is annoying, and the movie's direction raises many questions. The initial 30 minutes were captivating, but the eventual disappointment left me perplexed. Nonetheless, I still enjoyed the movie, even with its absurdities.Beekeeper seems like a John Wick movie - I acknowledge the similarities, but it's purely for entertainment, nothing beyond that!"
"The Beekeeper","slydon13","21 January 2024",NA,"When you see the opening credits - Minnie Driver, Jeremy Irons and Phylicia Rashad - the possiblity exists that this could be worth watching. Ms Driver only had the 2 scenes so she didn't have to be paid as much to surrender her dignity to keep a straight face . Jeremy Irons had to work much harder.The target audience is presumably teenage boys who don't expect or need a script. I presume the 3 actors named above where offered ridiculous money to be part of this enterprise. They are the comprobable film to the Hallmark Christmas movie (with everything pretty much similar to the cookie cutter used for all the previous examples )Presumably they had X number of required explosions , Y in the stunt crew, calculated Z as the number of scenes with a few gaps for words (lets not call it a script)The industry needs these kind of 'Expendeble' wholy forgettable flic to fill in.I only went to see this because I had a free ticket and if I had actually PAID money to see this, I'd likely be angry at my choice or disappointed.There are lots of better old films from the 30s, 40s, 50 etc . This was a waste of time but my autistic nephew loves going to the cinema and I'm part of his 'entertainment team'."

Now Statham i already know will do anything for big money...i mean, he was COMplimenting sly on the exPENdables... the stink of THAT movie was knocking people out who came CLOSE to the movie theaters it was playing in...one worse than the next... hey JASON...wanna play Tim Scott in Trump's upcoming biopic?

"The Beekeeper","samyakrout-65994","24 January 2024",NA,"The only good part the stealth and fitness of Jason Statham.This movie is so bad that where to start. Ofcourse the story didn't delayed and started immediately with a scam and then Jason went on killing spree.The first few actions were a bit relatable and ok but then the story became from good to bad and then worse when the president of USA showed up and the secret service could not even did the job they always were regarded as highly and that js to secure and save the president. No character building and not much of investigation.Its a one man show and the most irritating were those two FBI agents who for no reason were cracking boring jokes on each other and eve though they had chances but never cared to shoot him.The main villain who is again another immature gen z character who js always high on drugs was easily having drugs within the presidential house and killed the fbi director as if nothing to worry about.Damn boring boring and repetitive. All characters were so boring and irritable in nature.The best scene was the ending when i left my seat."
"The Beekeeper","chenp-54708","12 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper is one of those dumb stupid action movies that are so ridiculously dumb, yet still has some strong parts. Director David Ayer isn't a filmmaker I really like but I have enjoyed a few of his works like Training Day and End of Watch. His previous movie The Tax Collector was absolutely atrocious but The Beekeeper is slightly better than his last movie.Many of the action thrills, stunts, moments and scenes were ridiculous but for the most part, well-executed and shot pretty well. Although with some mix of poor editing and bad uses of CGI. All the performances were okay as Jason Statham still plays himself but still the fun aspect of the movie. The narrative is pretty ridiculous and kind of dumb where the more you think about it, the more dumber it becomes. The style definitely takes a bit too much influence on the John Wick series and some of the dialogue is quite laughable. But hey, all in all, I did enjoy some moments because it clearly doesn't take itself too seriously and the actions, thrills and Statham being himself was pretty fun."
"The Beekeeper","kmkevinn-64733","12 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper buzzes with intensity as it unveils a gripping tale of vengeance that transcends personal vendettas to impact an entire nation. The film takes you on a relentless journey with one man, a former operative of the enigmatic 'Beekeepers.' What begins as a brutal campaign for personal justice quickly escalates into a high-stakes thriller with national consequences. The storytelling is a masterclass maybe mediocre in suspense, weaving a web of intrigue and unveiling layers of a clandestine organization. The protagonist's journey from a solitary avenger to a player in a larger, more dangerous game is both compelling, almost average and chilling. The Beekeeper delivers not only on the promise of riveting action but also explores the shadowy realms of power and conspiracy, making it a must-watch for any fans of gripping thrillers with a touch of espionage intrigue. The 6/10 is appropriate."

Like the director just cut in the middle of a shot and said, ""screw it, let's go home.""(1 viewing, early screening UltraScreen 1/6/2024)"
"The Beekeeper","Neptune165","2 February 2024",NA,"Just when you think we have reached the bottom of filmmaking ... there is always something like this flick just to prove you can do a lot worse! It s so bland. The FBI agent was not professional and dressed and sounded dumb, lost mom by suicidal act and that did not play much of a roll after the incident,, the villains sounded stupid, especially the dip shots from the call centers. The story idea was great, Jason was awesome but the rest of the actors failed to bring it home. This movie is a terrible revenge story. The idea that Beekeepers are the most elite, well-trained, best equipped one man army is so over-used. The most unbelievable part is that he is hunted by mercenaries, law enforcement, and other Beekeepers. The acting is terrible, the storyline is worse."
"The Beekeeper","BA_Harrison","12 January 2024",NA,"After Fast X and The Meg 2, I swore I wouldn't waste any more of my time on Jason Statham movies, but the trailer for The Beekeeper looked good, so I thought I would give him one last chance. I just hoped that I wouldn't get stung again.Thankfully, this action flick from director David Ayer is as sweet as honey: it's unpretentious, over-the-top, gloriously violent nonsense that isn't to be taken seriously... the film is all about how many people the star can kill or maim during the 1hr 45minute runtime (the answer: a lot!).Statham plays Adam Clay, a beekeeper in more ways than one: he looks after bee hives on the farm owned by kindly Eloise Parker (Phylicia Rashad), but he's also a retired special operative known as a 'beekeeper', part of a government programme so secret even the FBI doesn't know about it. When Eloise loses all of her savings to scammers and commits suicide, Adam isn't a happy man and goes after those responsible, the trail leading all the way to the President of the United States (Jemma Redgrave).Buildings are blown up, limbs are broken, body parts are severed, people are shot, but Adam barely gets a scratch -- those looking for realism should look elsewhere. There's even a scene where a female beekeeper uses a mini-gun mounted on the back of a truck, and mini-guns always equal fun.At the end of the day, Adam makes the bad guys pay for their crimes, and promptly escapes, presumably to set up some more bee hives (the villains having shot up his earlier ones) and to prepare for the inevitable sequel."
"The Beekeeper","imseeg","12 January 2024",NA,"I was excited to see a new action movie with Jason Statham (one of my favorite ACTION actors) and although his figting scenes are still okay (ish), they weren't exhilirating. But there is something worse...The bad: Jason Statham (although in a leading role) doesnt get much screen time. A lot of the time we ONLY get to see a bunch of bland FBI agents, who arent impressing me in any way with their subpar acting performances.Nor do these FBI agents come across as credible by the way, constantly missing Jason Statham when they have all the time and opportunity to kill him point blank. Quite silly.More bad: the other supporting actors are really bad though, But they (AS WELL) do get a lot of screentime. So annoying.Not any good? Actor Jeremy Irons nails it. He plays the role of a cunning sophisticated bad guy and he is terrific. But what the heck is the distinguished and superb actor Jeremy Irons doing in such a cheap looking action movie? HE is the only redeeming feature of this movie though, besides a few action scenes with Jason Statham.Jason Statham fans beware, this one is quite a dud. Tedious, lame, uneventful."
"The Beekeeper","Xavier_Stone","10 January 2024",NA,"Written by Kurt Wimmer who is known for The Expendables which seems about right. Nearly all action which was ok, yet the story is just trash. If you're a fan of Jason then this one is just another average film with his stunts and fighting.Other than that the movie lacks any seriousness and the law enforcement roles are comical and everyone just comes out looking like keystone cops. It could have been so much better with a decent director and a lot of tweaks in the script.Sadly, not enough going on here to please anything but the Jason fans. 3 stars for action, zero for everything else. Even the ending is a zero. Park your brain before watching, no thinking required."
"The Beekeeper","martinrobertson300482","28 January 2024",NA,"Not sure why i went to see this one as i've not seen most of Jason Stathams movies. And if they're anything like this one i won't be in a rush to revisit them.The movie looked dumb, and it is. Statham is a beekeeper. Both metaphorically and genuinely. Infact the worst part of the film isn't how repetitive and boring the action gets (where Statham is practically untouchable). But the cringey push to make ex-military beekeeper tough guys a thing. You'll definitely get some laughs from how ridiculous it all is. But half the time I couldn't really tell if they were intentional laughs or not.I guess there is enough decent action. Like the farm scene, the middle office attack, and there's a decent brutal fight scene near the end. But even the most promising part of the movie - setting up the great villian for a well deserved ass kicking later. Doesn't pay off. So overall, pretty poor."
"The Beekeeper","banzoozalreviews","12 January 2024",NA,"David Ayer's ""The Beekeeper"" has Jason Statham going full John Wick and full Equalizer. This movie is 90 odd minutes of relentless, unhinged, pure escapist fun, with Statham doing what he does best - taking out bad guys like it's nothing and looking uber cool while doing it. He does that here in spades, in the most brutal and ridiculously entertaining ways. Yes, you need to throw believability aside, but if you are a fan of 80s and 90s action thrillers where it's one man against all, you will love this, just like I did. This movie really was a blast and a half, and then some. A great way to start 2024 movie season. I loved it. Pure escapist entertainment."
"The Beekeeper","kuner-59029","14 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper attempts to copy the John Wick formula to the point of plagiarism.The setup is virtually the same. Statham, playing himself as usual, is retired and extremely dangerous ex-assassin, member of a secret group called ""Beekeepers"". He get pulled out of retirement over a seemingly minor incident, and the conflict escalates.A woman he sells honey to (played by the mom from the Cosby Show) commits suicide after having her savings stolen by a scammer company.He takes revenge for her, but oh no, the company belongs to the president's no-good son (similar to the Russian Mob boss's son in the John Wick original).He fights his way to the top through many neon-lit setpieces until he reaches the final boss. The end.However, unlike John Wick, there is none of the fascinating world building, none of the flair, none of the great music editing, much of the acting is awful, and so the whole thing comes apart at the seams. Tonally, the film never hits the mark. Scenes variate between overacted and ridiculous to boring, slow paced and TV series like. Every time the narrative switches to a female FBI agent, the air is sucked out of the movie, and energy comes to a grinding halt.The use of music is awful. It alternates between Batman knock off cello and contrabass strings, which don't fit at all, to house and electronic in scenes where it doesn't fit either. It worked in John Wick, because it was woven into the story. John Wick was either in a night club, or the music was played on the Assassin's radio station. Here it just comes out of nowhere.There are a few good kills. The car off the drawbridge early on is excellent. The final boss fight was decent, but not over the top enough to be memorable.Overall, this is a poorly made film that you will forget the moment you finish it. It's barely watchable, but I deducted points for plagiarism."
"The Beekeeper","sbweightman","12 January 2024",NA,"A really enjoyable revenge action film full of fast paced action and corny bee-related dialogue. Although the character's backstory has been done many times before, the plot has some modern ideas and modern villains which are easy to hate and the strong moral message was quite refreshing. Good acting from a good cast of characters and whilst some of the henchmen are a bit silly, their larger than life presence adds some surprises into what is otherwise pretty standard fare. Good pacing, music and fight scenes keep it entertaining throughout, although the start is pretty slow and the ending rather abrupt."
"The Beekeeper","olcare","10 January 2024",NA,"I mean, I don't know what to say; it feels like the movie's script was randomly written without any thought. The events are so poorly explained that I couldn't believe it while watching. I have no idea how they shot it. I'm addressing everyone who watched and gave good ratings: watch it again, life is not that simple.I want to mention Jason Statham. The only good thing in the movie is Jason. He is more than an actor; he's an excellent athlete, continuing this for years and elevating all the action scenes in every action movie. In some fight scenes in this film, extras stand there taking hits flatly, and it's entirely the fault of those who planned the scenes.There's no recognizable plot; the character just walks straight into the president of some made-up country's house, kills 30 people, and we watch this for 1 hour and 40 minutes. The FBI is portrayed as if it's a village organization; the detectives hang out like it's their dad's farm. It's unbelievable. They wrote a movie without sitting down and thinking about these details; it's astonishing.The Beekeeper program is constantly mentioned in the film, but what is it? What do these people do? How were they trained? What hardships did they endure? None of it is there; they just expect us to believe in a name. There's nothing about how the top-secret deadly agents of the government are trained.Money theft and the presidential race are portrayed like child's play. These are not people you can easily reach; to blow up a building or enter the president's mansion, you need an incredibly good script, and this film has none of that.The acting is also bad, except for Jason Statham. There's no good performance except him. The character's motivation is bad too; killing 100 people because a woman who treated him well while beekeeping shot herself. We should have seen a 3-5 minute segment about their intimacy.I don't know what else to say; it just goes on and on, complete bulls**t. I'm thinking about David Ayer's early works, and nowadays, each film he makes is dragging everything further down. The screenwriter, Kurt Wimmer, has also messed up; he wrote it thoughtlessly. I'm eagerly anticipating the film's complete failure at the box office. Definitely a waste of time.."
"The Beekeeper","UniqueParticle","11 January 2024",NA,"So glad I got to see an early screening in imax on 1-6-24 just couldn't review yet. Anyway such an enriching thrill ride to satisfy any action fan of badass one man army types kinda like John Wick with a different style to it! I've been a fan of Jason Statham for a couple decades now and this is one of his best. The writing is magnificent too Kurt Whimmer is perfect for in depth action extravaganza.For an autistic person that's been scammed numerous times Beekeeper hit the spot; I absolutely loved the way everything played out. Well directed, crystal smooth writing, amazing story and top notch action; highly recommend I'll definitely want to own in 4K!"
"The Beekeeper","dam-24421","31 January 2024",NA,"They forgot to write a script? Or bring their head along in this movie?Nothing seemed to work, acting, storyline, everything was so rushed. The actors were incredibly bad, especially Parker. That must be some of the most cringe, b acting I have ever seen. It was unwatchable, I stayed in the cinema because I had my little brother with me, and wouldn't be rude and interfere with the other people in the cinema.This movies gets -3/10Way too cheesy and cringe. David Ayer this is a redo, better luck next time. My sincere condolences for the people watching.Just another movie for the money, so sad."
"The Beekeeper","petercarlsson-92297","30 January 2024",NA,"Jason Statham does the same movie - again - that he's been doing the last 20 years. This time without a script. They just stacked a number of fight and action scenes on top of each other, then called it a movie.Statham has done a few rather good movies like this. For example ""Homefront"". That movie had a script and good acting. But this... What is this? Is it made for teenage boys? For adults? For girls? Boys? I don't know, but the result is nothing new, nothing thrilling and nothing fun.So what do we got. Well, that's a really good question. The problem is that there's very, very hard to find a good answer."
"The Beekeeper","Brillfury","13 January 2024",NA,"Look,I love a good action flick as much as anyone, and Jason Statham is usually awesome. But sadly director David Ayer delivers what will probably be one of the worst movies of 2024. Ayer made one great movie over 20 years ago (Training Day) and also delivered a good flick in Fury, but everything else he makes is horrible. I will admit I did get a kick out of how dumb and goofy this movie is, and laughed a lot. Statham's character is like a cardboard box, it's so boring. Yes his fighting scenes are very cool but he's played awesome characters before that also had a bit of kick. In this movie he gives us nothing.Phylicia Rashad looks fabulous and gets about 5 minutes of screen time. Jeremy Irons and Josh Hutcherson do a great job but their talents are wasted in this movie.The plot starts out really promising...who wouldn't love to see a revenge action movie where the evil call centers get justice? But sadly the premise is wasted.Oh if you love hearing the word ""Beekeeper"" and references to bees you'll love this.The dialogue in this movie is so corny. It's almost like a satire of action movies at some points.In David Ayer's world, nothing works like it actually does in the real world. It is so goofy the way he portrays everything. And this is something he does in a lot of his movies. Just dumb fictional versions of everything from presidents to agencies to how classified programs work. But I do understand they have to make movies and sometimes make everything really stupid to be entertaining. But this movie takes the cake. For instance, call center scams are a real thing and there are many YouTube videos showing how they operate. But in this movie, the call center office is the most over the top clown spectacle you'll ever see and the actual scam is a ludicrous fictionalized version of how they actually work.The two main FBI agents are portrayed goofy AF and their dialogue is nearly unbearable.Statham's character, the beekeeper, doesn't want you to steal from old people but he has no qualms with murdering about 50 federal law enforcement officers in the course of the movie without batting an eye.So if you are about 13 years old this movie will be the coolest thing you've seen but anywhere over that and it's just too dumb. Maybe when it's on streaming it might be fun to watch and make fun of on a rainy day."
"The Beekeeper","TheNamelessCzar","27 January 2024",NA,"This may be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in the theater. I should've known better knowing I was going to see a Jason Statham movie. He has no talent, and he simply is known for his name and his action/fighting skills. But the reviews were so good! Apparently, the reviewers were paid off. The plot is ridiculous, and the acting skills were as bad as a high school drama club,. At times, I felt like I was watching ann episode of NOVA learning all sorts of things about bees. Statham has one facial expression in the movie, and it looks like boredom. Never again will I see on of his movie sin the theater... I'll wait to bore myself at home when it comes on streaming instead."
"The Beekeeper","masonsaul","13 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper isn't as tight or condensed as the films it borrows from thanks to an unexpectedly dense mythology but it really delivers where it counts. It's essentially Jason Statham beating people up for 100 minutes and it never gets old. Thankfully it doesn't really sequel bait however more of these would definitely be welcome.Jason Statham is never bad even when he's in a dud like a few of his recent films. Even so, it's nice to see his talent and physicality employed in something actually good. Jeremy Irons has the ability to deliver exposition about beekeeping in an engaging manner and Josh Hutcherson is actually awake for this one.Similarly to Statham, David Ayer has had a few misses so it's equally rewarding to see him back doing what he knows best whilst showing he and his team are really good at hand to hand combat. The score by David Sardy & Jared Michael Fry is a huge part of why this works, treating the dumbest twists with the utmost seriousness."
"The Beekeeper","masonfisk","30 January 2024",NA,"The first film of the year may rank as one of the worst for the same as Jason Statham kicks butts & takes names (or is it the other way around?) in this goofy revenge tale. Statham, a former government operative, has retired plying his trade running an apiary on a retired woman's property, Phylicia Rashad, but after she commits suicide after being ripped off by some internet sharks prompting Statham to spew bad bee puns while he kills his way to the top (or bottom, these people are scum!) in a concern which runs right to the heights of the White House as the president's, Gemma Redgrave, (from Howard's End) son, played by Josh Hutcherson, is raking in millions from duped customers which will not stand as far as Statham is concerned. David Ayer, a mismatched director for this material (was Shane Black busy?), directs a particularly goofy premise from scenarist David Wimmer, does not help a whit w/humorless Statham doing the physical lifting w/o any issues but the unintentional guffaws generated from villains who look like extras from The Terminator's Tech-noir dance club scene makes this memorable outing for the wrong reasons. Also starring Oscar winner Jeremy Irons as Redgrave's handler, Oscar nominee Minnie Driver (wasted frankly!) as a government contact & Emmy Raver-Lampman (from The Umbrella Academy) who plays Rashad's daughter."
"The Beekeeper","timeblank","21 January 2024",NA,"I fell victim to a scam, and it's satisfying to see scammers getting their due in the Beekeeper movie. Jason Statham's action-packed destruction of the building and culprits is glorious. Despite the absurd plot, the theme of justice prevails. The constant investigation of Statham's crimes is annoying, and the movie's direction raises many questions. The initial 30 minutes were captivating, but the eventual disappointment left me perplexed. Nonetheless, I still enjoyed the movie, even with its absurdities.Beekeeper seems like a John Wick movie - I acknowledge the similarities, but it's purely for entertainment, nothing beyond that!"
"The Beekeeper","slydon13","21 January 2024",NA,"When you see the opening credits - Minnie Driver, Jeremy Irons and Phylicia Rashad - the possiblity exists that this could be worth watching. Ms Driver only had the 2 scenes so she didn't have to be paid as much to surrender her dignity to keep a straight face . Jeremy Irons had to work much harder.The target audience is presumably teenage boys who don't expect or need a script. I presume the 3 actors named above where offered ridiculous money to be part of this enterprise. They are the comprobable film to the Hallmark Christmas movie (with everything pretty much similar to the cookie cutter used for all the previous examples )Presumably they had X number of required explosions , Y in the stunt crew, calculated Z as the number of scenes with a few gaps for words (lets not call it a script)The industry needs these kind of 'Expendeble' wholy forgettable flic to fill in.I only went to see this because I had a free ticket and if I had actually PAID money to see this, I'd likely be angry at my choice or disappointed.There are lots of better old films from the 30s, 40s, 50 etc .

Ofcourse the story didn't delayed and started immediately with a scam and then Jason went on killing spree.The first few actions were a bit relatable and ok but then the story became from good to bad and then worse when the president of USA showed up and the secret service could not even did the job they always were regarded as highly and that js to secure and save the president. No character building and not much of investigation.Its a one man show and the most irritating were those two FBI agents who for no reason were cracking boring jokes on each other and eve though they had chances but never cared to shoot him.The main villain who is again another immature gen z character who js always high on drugs was easily having drugs within the presidential house and killed the fbi director as if nothing to worry about.Damn boring boring and repetitive. All characters were so boring and irritable in nature.The best scene was the ending when i left my seat."
"The Beekeeper","chenp-54708","12 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper is one of those dumb stupid action movies that are so ridiculously dumb, yet still has some strong parts. Director David Ayer isn't a filmmaker I really like but I have enjoyed a few of his works like Training Day and End of Watch. His previous movie The Tax Collector was absolutely atrocious but The Beekeeper is slightly better than his last movie.Many of the action thrills, stunts, moments and scenes were ridiculous but for the most part, well-executed and shot pretty well. Although with some mix of poor editing and bad uses of CGI. All the performances were okay as Jason Statham still plays himself but still the fun aspect of the movie. The narrative is pretty ridiculous and kind of dumb where the more you think about it, the more dumber it becomes. The style definitely takes a bit too much influence on the John Wick series and some of the dialogue is quite laughable. But hey, all in all, I did enjoy some moments because it clearly doesn't take itself too seriously and the actions, thrills and Statham being himself was pretty fun."
"The Beekeeper","kmkevinn-64733","12 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper buzzes with intensity as it unveils a gripping tale of vengeance that transcends personal vendettas to impact an entire nation. The film takes you on a relentless journey with one man, a former operative of the enigmatic 'Beekeepers.' What begins as a brutal campaign for personal justice quickly escalates into a high-stakes thriller with national consequences. The storytelling is a masterclass maybe mediocre in suspense, weaving a web of intrigue and unveiling layers of a clandestine organization. The protagonist's journey from a solitary avenger to a player in a larger, more dangerous game is both compelling, almost average and chilling. The Beekeeper delivers not only on the promise of riveting action but also explores the shadowy realms of power and conspiracy, making it a must-watch for any fans of gripping thrillers with a touch of espionage intrigue. The 6/10 is appropriate."
"The Beekeeper","DocteurDream","30 January 2024",NA,"Verona Parker is easily one of the worst characters ever written for the screen, takes away everything this movie aspires to be. The actress also did a piss poor job and always had me cringing at the unrealistic and unreasonable choices she makes. If you'd delete that character entirely, this movie would've been a whole lot better in the long run.Subject wise it's a very nice concept of a revenge thriller against scam call centers- but again, the whole govt mumbo jumbo makes it feel a whole run of the mill action BS from Hollywood mid tier movies. If the story had been awhole lot grounded, it would've done a whole lot better imo."
"The Beekeeper","kjproulx","12 January 2024",NA,"By now, audiences should realize what they are in for when it comes to Jason Statham leading an action film. The Beekeeper is the latest film to continue his long-running legacy of action flicks and it's quite a bit of fun. It's very far from an awards nominee, but for a film I had zero expectations for, and for being as cheesy as it is, it's pretty good. Take that as you will because I will be diving into things that are also pretty bad as well. The cheesiness of this film will turn some people off, but I was able to ignore it. Here's why I recommend The Beekeeper if you want to watch a new action-packed film to enjoy and not have to think too much about.The ""Beekeepers"" is an organization of hitmen who take out criminals. Jason Statham plays Adam Clay, a retiree from this organization, who is on a manhunt for everyone involved in scamming a woman he cared for, which led to her suicide. It's as simple as that. There are multiple bosses in this company, so it's like watching a sophisticated video game being played out. The action sequences are well-choreographed and there are quite a few action scenes, so overall, this film was a blast to watch. With that said, the dialogue from beginning to end it pretty atrocious.If the script had been reworked, I think this could've been a surprisingly great film as a whole. Sadly, the dialogue is full of Bee puns that fall flat almost every time, even with solid actors delivering them. The character arc and dialogue for Josh Hutcherson's Derek Danforth (who is the main villain of the film) is laughable, and not really in a good way. His whiny, self-entitled performance was great and I liked that he was giving this character his all, it's just that, again, the dialogue sucks. The lines everyone was saying took me out of the experience many times. Still, there is a lot of great action, and that's what I wanted from a movie like this anyway. I'm sure the dialogue will have people hating this movie and I'm equally sure certain people will find it hilarious. I'm kind of in the middle.The Beekeeper is David Ayer's latest directorial effort and as always, he does a great job with action. His touch as a director is always welcomed by me and the neon look to the film was cool as well. It's a cool film to watch and it's aesthetically pleasing. I may be ripping apart the script, but it's just the dialogue. The story itself plays out nicely and has a nice resolution. I was looking for a fun action film and this film delivered that, despite its downfalls. I say check it out."
"The Beekeeper","FeastMode","12 January 2024",NA,"I seem to use that headline a lot. I guess it's better than a bad movie with bad fight scenes.Starting with the good, Statham is awesome as usual. And I loved all of the fight scenes. They are ridiculously fast yet completely clear. It's hard hitting, you can feel the blows. This is enhanced by the beastly IMAX speakers. And with the R-rating, it doesn't hold back. Although it's far from gratuitous.The bad? Sigh. The non-action scenes, which make up the majority of the movie, range from average to terrible. The quality level feels like a streaming movie, not a theatrical one. I spent much of the runtime uninterested and unengaged.Everything feels off. The dialogue is weird. The acting is questionable. And there are a bunch of dumb things that strain believability. Like the entire bad guy organization. Or a laugh-out-loud idiotic character decision during the climax. A true ""are you kidding me?"" moment.Even the cut to credits felt odd.

It could have been so much better with a decent director and a lot of tweaks in the script.Sadly, not enough going on here to please anything but the Jason fans. 3 stars for action, zero for everything else. Even the ending is a zero. Park your brain before watching, no thinking required."
"The Beekeeper","martinrobertson300482","28 January 2024",NA,"Not sure why i went to see this one as i've not seen most of Jason Stathams movies. And if they're anything like this one i won't be in a rush to revisit them.The movie looked dumb, and it is. Statham is a beekeeper. Both metaphorically and genuinely. Infact the worst part of the film isn't how repetitive and boring the action gets (where Statham is practically untouchable). But the cringey push to make ex-military beekeeper tough guys a thing. You'll definitely get some laughs from how ridiculous it all is. But half the time I couldn't really tell if they were intentional laughs or not.I guess there is enough decent action. Like the farm scene, the middle office attack, and there's a decent brutal fight scene near the end. But even the most promising part of the movie - setting up the great villian for a well deserved ass kicking later. Doesn't pay off. So overall, pretty poor."
"The Beekeeper","banzoozalreviews","12 January 2024",NA,"David Ayer's ""The Beekeeper"" has Jason Statham going full John Wick and full Equalizer. This movie is 90 odd minutes of relentless, unhinged, pure escapist fun, with Statham doing what he does best - taking out bad guys like it's nothing and looking uber cool while doing it. He does that here in spades, in the most brutal and ridiculously entertaining ways. Yes, you need to throw believability aside, but if you are a fan of 80s and 90s action thrillers where it's one man against all, you will love this, just like I did. This movie really was a blast and a half, and then some. A great way to start 2024 movie season. I loved it. Pure escapist entertainment."
"The Beekeeper","kuner-59029","14 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper attempts to copy the John Wick formula to the point of plagiarism.The setup is virtually the same. Statham, playing himself as usual, is retired and extremely dangerous ex-assassin, member of a secret group called ""Beekeepers"". He get pulled out of retirement over a seemingly minor incident, and the conflict escalates.A woman he sells honey to (played by the mom from the Cosby Show) commits suicide after having her savings stolen by a scammer company.He takes revenge for her, but oh no, the company belongs to the president's no-good son (similar to the Russian Mob boss's son in the John Wick original).He fights his way to the top through many neon-lit setpieces until he reaches the final boss. The end.However, unlike John Wick, there is none of the fascinating world building, none of the flair, none of the great music editing, much of the acting is awful, and so the whole thing comes apart at the seams. Tonally, the film never hits the mark. Scenes variate between overacted and ridiculous to boring, slow paced and TV series like. Every time the narrative switches to a female FBI agent, the air is sucked out of the movie, and energy comes to a grinding halt.The use of music is awful. It alternates between Batman knock off cello and contrabass strings, which don't fit at all, to house and electronic in scenes where it doesn't fit either. It worked in John Wick, because it was woven into the story. John Wick was either in a night club, or the music was played on the Assassin's radio station. Here it just comes out of nowhere.There are a few good kills. The car off the drawbridge early on is excellent. The final boss fight was decent, but not over the top enough to be memorable.Overall, this is a poorly made film that you will forget the moment you finish it. It's barely watchable, but I deducted points for plagiarism."
"The Beekeeper","sbweightman","12 January 2024",NA,"A really enjoyable revenge action film full of fast paced action and corny bee-related dialogue. Although the character's backstory has been done many times before, the plot has some modern ideas and modern villains which are easy to hate and the strong moral message was quite refreshing. Good acting from a good cast of characters and whilst some of the henchmen are a bit silly, their larger than life presence adds some surprises into what is otherwise pretty standard fare. Good pacing, music and fight scenes keep it entertaining throughout, although the start is pretty slow and the ending rather abrupt."
"The Beekeeper","olcare","10 January 2024",NA,"I mean, I don't know what to say; it feels like the movie's script was randomly written without any thought. The events are so poorly explained that I couldn't believe it while watching. I have no idea how they shot it. I'm addressing everyone who watched and gave good ratings: watch it again, life is not that simple.I want to mention Jason Statham. The only good thing in the movie is Jason. He is more than an actor; he's an excellent athlete, continuing this for years and elevating all the action scenes in every action movie. In some fight scenes in this film, extras stand there taking hits flatly, and it's entirely the fault of those who planned the scenes.There's no recognizable plot; the character just walks straight into the president of some made-up country's house, kills 30 people, and we watch this for 1 hour and 40 minutes. The FBI is portrayed as if it's a village organization; the detectives hang out like it's their dad's farm. It's unbelievable. They wrote a movie without sitting down and thinking about these details; it's astonishing.The Beekeeper program is constantly mentioned in the film, but what is it? What do these people do? How were they trained? What hardships did they endure? None of it is there; they just expect us to believe in a name. There's nothing about how the top-secret deadly agents of the government are trained.Money theft and the presidential race are portrayed like child's play. These are not people you can easily reach; to blow up a building or enter the president's mansion, you need an incredibly good script, and this film has none of that.The acting is also bad, except for Jason Statham. There's no good performance except him. The character's motivation is bad too; killing 100 people because a woman who treated him well while beekeeping shot herself. We should have seen a 3-5 minute segment about their intimacy.I don't know what else to say; it just goes on and on, complete bulls**t. I'm thinking about David Ayer's early works, and nowadays, each film he makes is dragging everything further down. The screenwriter, Kurt Wimmer, has also messed up; he wrote it thoughtlessly. I'm eagerly anticipating the film's complete failure at the box office. Definitely a waste of time.."
"The Beekeeper","UniqueParticle","11 January 2024",NA,"So glad I got to see an early screening in imax on 1-6-24 just couldn't review yet. Anyway such an enriching thrill ride to satisfy any action fan of badass one man army types kinda like John Wick with a different style to it! I've been a fan of Jason Statham for a couple decades now and this is one of his best. The writing is magnificent too Kurt Whimmer is perfect for in depth action extravaganza.For an autistic person that's been scammed numerous times Beekeeper hit the spot; I absolutely loved the way everything played out. Well directed, crystal smooth writing, amazing story and top notch action; highly recommend I'll definitely want to own in 4K!"
"The Beekeeper","dam-24421","31 January 2024",NA,"They forgot to write a script? Or bring their head along in this movie?Nothing seemed to work, acting, storyline, everything was so rushed. The actors were incredibly bad, especially Parker. That must be some of the most cringe, b acting I have ever seen. It was unwatchable, I stayed in the cinema because I had my little brother with me, and wouldn't be rude and interfere with the other people in the cinema.This movies gets -3/10Way too cheesy and cringe. David Ayer this is a redo, better luck next time. My sincere condolences for the people watching.Just another movie for the money, so sad."
"The Beekeeper","petercarlsson-92297","30 January 2024",NA,"Jason Statham does the same movie - again - that he's been doing the last 20 years. This time without a script. They just stacked a number of fight and action scenes on top of each other, then called it a movie.Statham has done a few rather good movies like this. For example ""Homefront"". That movie had a script and good acting. But this... What is this? Is it made for teenage boys? For adults? For girls? Boys? I don't know, but the result is nothing new, nothing thrilling and nothing fun.So what do we got. Well, that's a really good question. The problem is that there's very, very hard to find a good answer."
"The Beekeeper","Brillfury","13 January 2024",NA,"Look,I love a good action flick as much as anyone, and Jason Statham is usually awesome. But sadly director David Ayer delivers what will probably be one of the worst movies of 2024. Ayer made one great movie over 20 years ago (Training Day) and also delivered a good flick in Fury, but everything else he makes is horrible. I will admit I did get a kick out of how dumb and goofy this movie is, and laughed a lot. Statham's character is like a cardboard box, it's so boring. Yes his fighting scenes are very cool but he's played awesome characters before that also had a bit of kick. In this movie he gives us nothing.Phylicia Rashad looks fabulous and gets about 5 minutes of screen time. Jeremy Irons and Josh Hutcherson do a great job but their talents are wasted in this movie.The plot starts out really promising...who wouldn't love to see a revenge action movie where the evil call centers get justice? But sadly the premise is wasted.Oh if you love hearing the word ""Beekeeper"" and references to bees you'll love this.The dialogue in this movie is so corny. It's almost like a satire of action movies at some points.In David Ayer's world, nothing works like it actually does in the real world. It is so goofy the way he portrays everything. And this is something he does in a lot of his movies. Just dumb fictional versions of everything from presidents to agencies to how classified programs work. But I do understand they have to make movies and sometimes make everything really stupid to be entertaining. But this movie takes the cake. For instance, call center scams are a real thing and there are many YouTube videos showing how they operate. But in this movie, the call center office is the most over the top clown spectacle you'll ever see and the actual scam is a ludicrous fictionalized version of how they actually work.The two main FBI agents are portrayed goofy AF and their dialogue is nearly unbearable.Statham's character, the beekeeper, doesn't want you to steal from old people but he has no qualms with murdering about 50 federal law enforcement officers in the course of the movie without batting an eye.So if you are about 13 years old this movie will be the coolest thing you've seen but anywhere over that and it's just too dumb. Maybe when it's on streaming it might be fun to watch and make fun of on a rainy day."
"The Beekeeper","TheNamelessCzar","27 January 2024",NA,"This may be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in the theater. I should've known better knowing I was going to see a Jason Statham movie. He has no talent, and he simply is known for his name and his action/fighting skills. But the reviews were so good! Apparently, the reviewers were paid off. The plot is ridiculous, and the acting skills were as bad as a high school drama club,. At times, I felt like I was watching ann episode of NOVA learning all sorts of things about bees. Statham has one facial expression in the movie, and it looks like boredom. Never again will I see on of his movie sin the theater... I'll wait to bore myself at home when it comes on streaming instead."
"The Beekeeper","masonsaul","13 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper isn't as tight or condensed as the films it borrows from thanks to an unexpectedly dense mythology but it really delivers where it counts. It's essentially Jason Statham beating people up for 100 minutes and it never gets old. Thankfully it doesn't really sequel bait however more of these would definitely be welcome.Jason Statham is never bad even when he's in a dud like a few of his recent films. Even so, it's nice to see his talent and physicality employed in something actually good. Jeremy Irons has the ability to deliver exposition about beekeeping in an engaging manner and Josh Hutcherson is actually awake for this one.Similarly to Statham, David Ayer has had a few misses so it's equally rewarding to see him back doing what he knows best whilst showing he and his team are really good at hand to hand combat. The score by David Sardy & Jared Michael Fry is a huge part of why this works, treating the dumbest twists with the utmost seriousness."
"The Beekeeper","masonfisk","30 January 2024",NA,"The first film of the year may rank as one of the worst for the same as Jason Statham kicks butts & takes names (or is it the other way around?) in this goofy revenge tale. Statham, a former government operative, has retired plying his trade running an apiary on a retired woman's property, Phylicia Rashad, but after she commits suicide after being ripped off by some internet sharks prompting Statham to spew bad bee puns while he kills his way to the top (or bottom, these people are scum!) in a concern which runs right to the heights of the White House as the president's, Gemma Redgrave, (from Howard's End) son, played by Josh Hutcherson, is raking in millions from duped customers which will not stand as far as Statham is concerned. David Ayer, a mismatched director for this material (was Shane Black busy?), directs a particularly goofy premise from scenarist David Wimmer, does not help a whit w/humorless Statham doing the physical lifting w/o any issues but the unintentional guffaws generated from villains who look like extras from The Terminator's Tech-noir dance club scene makes this memorable outing for the wrong reasons. Also starring Oscar winner Jeremy Irons as Redgrave's handler, Oscar nominee Minnie Driver (wasted frankly!) as a government contact & Emmy Raver-Lampman (from The Umbrella Academy) who plays Rashad's daughter."
"The Beekeeper","timeblank","21 January 2024",NA,"I fell victim to a scam, and it's satisfying to see scammers getting their due in the Beekeeper movie. Jason Statham's action-packed destruction of the building and culprits is glorious. Despite the absurd plot, the theme of justice prevails. The constant investigation of Statham's crimes is annoying, and the movie's direction raises many questions. The initial 30 minutes were captivating, but the eventual disappointment left me perplexed. Nonetheless, I still enjoyed the movie, even with its absurdities.Beekeeper seems like a John Wick movie - I acknowledge the similarities, but it's purely for entertainment, nothing beyond that!"
"The Beekeeper","slydon13","21 January 2024",NA,"When you see the opening credits - Minnie Driver, Jeremy Irons and Phylicia Rashad - the possiblity exists that this could be worth watching. Ms Driver only had the 2 scenes so she didn't have to be paid as much to surrender her dignity to keep a straight face . Jeremy Irons had to work much harder.The target audience is presumably teenage boys who don't expect or need a script. I presume the 3 actors named above where offered ridiculous money to be part of this enterprise. They are the comprobable film to the Hallmark Christmas movie (with everything pretty much similar to the cookie cutter used for all the previous examples )Presumably they had X number of required explosions , Y in the stunt crew, calculated Z as the number of scenes with a few gaps for words (lets not call it a script)The industry needs these kind of 'Expendeble' wholy forgettable flic to fill in.I only went to see this because I had a free ticket and if I had actually PAID money to see this, I'd likely be angry at my choice or disappointed.There are lots of better old films from the 30s, 40s, 50 etc . This was a waste of time but my autistic nephew loves going to the cinema and I'm part of his 'entertainment team'."

"The Beekeeper","samyakrout-65994","24 January 2024",NA,"The only good part the stealth and fitness of Jason Statham.This movie is so bad that where to start. Ofcourse the story didn't delayed and started immediately with a scam and then Jason went on killing spree.The first few actions were a bit relatable and ok but then the story became from good to bad and then worse when the president of USA showed up and the secret service could not even did the job they always were regarded as highly and that js to secure and save the president. No character building and not much of investigation.Its a one man show and the most irritating were those two FBI agents who for no reason were cracking boring jokes on each other and eve though they had chances but never cared to shoot him.The main villain who is again another immature gen z character who js always high on drugs was easily having drugs within the presidential house and killed the fbi director as if nothing to worry about.Damn boring boring and repetitive. All characters were so boring and irritable in nature.The best scene was the ending when i left my seat."
"The Beekeeper","chenp-54708","12 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper is one of those dumb stupid action movies that are so ridiculously dumb, yet still has some strong parts. Director David Ayer isn't a filmmaker I really like but I have enjoyed a few of his works like Training Day and End of Watch. His previous movie The Tax Collector was absolutely atrocious but The Beekeeper is slightly better than his last movie.Many of the action thrills, stunts, moments and scenes were ridiculous but for the most part, well-executed and shot pretty well. Although with some mix of poor editing and bad uses of CGI. All the performances were okay as Jason Statham still plays himself but still the fun aspect of the movie. The narrative is pretty ridiculous and kind of dumb where the more you think about it, the more dumber it becomes. The style definitely takes a bit too much influence on the John Wick series and some of the dialogue is quite laughable. But hey, all in all, I did enjoy some moments because it clearly doesn't take itself too seriously and the actions, thrills and Statham being himself was pretty fun."
"The Beekeeper","kmkevinn-64733","12 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper buzzes with intensity as it unveils a gripping tale of vengeance that transcends personal vendettas to impact an entire nation. The film takes you on a relentless journey with one man, a former operative of the enigmatic 'Beekeepers.' What begins as a brutal campaign for personal justice quickly escalates into a high-stakes thriller with national consequences. The storytelling is a masterclass maybe mediocre in suspense, weaving a web of intrigue and unveiling layers of a clandestine organization. The protagonist's journey from a solitary avenger to a player in a larger, more dangerous game is both compelling, almost average and chilling. The Beekeeper delivers not only on the promise of riveting action but also explores the shadowy realms of power and conspiracy, making it a must-watch for any fans of gripping thrillers with a touch of espionage intrigue. The 6/10 is appropriate."
"The Beekeeper","DocteurDream","30 January 2024",NA,"Verona Parker is easily one of the worst characters ever written for the screen, takes away everything this movie aspires to be. The actress also did a piss poor job and always had me cringing at the unrealistic and unreasonable choices she makes. If you'd delete that character entirely, this movie would've been a whole lot better in the long run.Subject wise it's a very nice concept of a revenge thriller against scam call centers- but again, the whole govt mumbo jumbo makes it feel a whole run of the mill action BS from Hollywood mid tier movies. If the story had been awhole lot grounded, it would've done a whole lot better imo."
"The Beekeeper","kjproulx","12 January 2024",NA,"By now, audiences should realize what they are in for when it comes to Jason Statham leading an action film. The Beekeeper is the latest film to continue his long-running legacy of action flicks and it's quite a bit of fun. It's very far from an awards nominee, but for a film I had zero expectations for, and for being as cheesy as it is, it's pretty good. Take that as you will because I will be diving into things that are also pretty bad as well. The cheesiness of this film will turn some people off, but I was able to ignore it. Here's why I recommend The Beekeeper if you want to watch a new action-packed film to enjoy and not have to think too much about.The ""Beekeepers"" is an organization of hitmen who take out criminals. Jason Statham plays Adam Clay, a retiree from this organization, who is on a manhunt for everyone involved in scamming a woman he cared for, which led to her suicide. It's as simple as that. There are multiple bosses in this company, so it's like watching a sophisticated video game being played out. The action sequences are well-choreographed and there are quite a few action scenes, so overall, this film was a blast to watch. With that said, the dialogue from beginning to end it pretty atrocious.If the script had been reworked, I think this could've been a surprisingly great film as a whole. Sadly, the dialogue is full of Bee puns that fall flat almost every time, even with solid actors delivering them. The character arc and dialogue for Josh Hutcherson's Derek Danforth (who is the main villain of the film) is laughable, and not really in a good way. His whiny, self-entitled performance was great and I liked that he was giving this character his all, it's just that, again, the dialogue sucks. The lines everyone was saying took me out of the experience many times. Still, there is a lot of great action, and that's what I wanted from a movie like this anyway. I'm sure the dialogue will have people hating this movie and I'm equally sure certain people will find it hilarious. I'm kind of in the middle.The Beekeeper is David Ayer's latest directorial effort and as always, he does a great job with action. His touch as a director is always welcomed by me and the neon look to the film was cool as well. It's a cool film to watch and it's aesthetically pleasing. I may be ripping apart the script, but it's just the dialogue. The story itself plays out nicely and has a nice resolution. I was looking for a fun action film and this film delivered that, despite its downfalls. I say check it out."
"The Beekeeper","FeastMode","12 January 2024",NA,"I seem to use that headline a lot. I guess it's better than a bad movie with bad fight scenes.Starting with the good, Statham is awesome as usual. And I loved all of the fight scenes. They are ridiculously fast yet completely clear. It's hard hitting, you can feel the blows. This is enhanced by the beastly IMAX speakers. And with the R-rating, it doesn't hold back. Although it's far from gratuitous.The bad? Sigh. The non-action scenes, which make up the majority of the movie, range from average to terrible. The quality level feels like a streaming movie, not a theatrical one. I spent much of the runtime uninterested and unengaged.Everything feels off. The dialogue is weird. The acting is questionable. And there are a bunch of dumb things that strain believability. Like the entire bad guy organization. Or a laugh-out-loud idiotic character decision during the climax. A true ""are you kidding me?"" moment.Even the cut to credits felt odd. Like the director just cut in the middle of a shot and said, ""screw it, let's go home.""(1 viewing, early screening UltraScreen 1/6/2024)"
"The Beekeeper","Neptune165","2 February 2024",NA,"Just when you think we have reached the bottom of filmmaking ... there is always something like this flick just to prove you can do a lot worse! It s so bland. The FBI agent was not professional and dressed and sounded dumb, lost mom by suicidal act and that did not play much of a roll after the incident,, the villains sounded stupid, especially the dip shots from the call centers. The story idea was great, Jason was awesome but the rest of the actors failed to bring it home. This movie is a terrible revenge story. The idea that Beekeepers are the most elite, well-trained, best equipped one man army is so over-used. The most unbelievable part is that he is hunted by mercenaries, law enforcement, and other Beekeepers. The acting is terrible, the storyline is worse."
"The Beekeeper","BA_Harrison","12 January 2024",NA,"After Fast X and The Meg 2, I swore I wouldn't waste any more of my time on Jason Statham movies, but the trailer for The Beekeeper looked good, so I thought I would give him one last chance. I just hoped that I wouldn't get stung again.Thankfully, this action flick from director David Ayer is as sweet as honey: it's unpretentious, over-the-top, gloriously violent nonsense that isn't to be taken seriously... the film is all about how many people the star can kill or maim during the 1hr 45minute runtime (the answer: a lot!).Statham plays Adam Clay, a beekeeper in more ways than one: he looks after bee hives on the farm owned by kindly Eloise Parker (Phylicia Rashad), but he's also a retired special operative known as a 'beekeeper', part of a government programme so secret even the FBI doesn't know about it. When Eloise loses all of her savings to scammers and commits suicide, Adam isn't a happy man and goes after those responsible, the trail leading all the way to the President of the United States (Jemma Redgrave).Buildings are blown up, limbs are broken, body parts are severed, people are shot, but Adam barely gets a scratch -- those looking for realism should look elsewhere. There's even a scene where a female beekeeper uses a mini-gun mounted on the back of a truck, and mini-guns always equal fun.At the end of the day, Adam makes the bad guys pay for their crimes, and promptly escapes, presumably to set up some more bee hives (the villains having shot up his earlier ones) and to prepare for the inevitable sequel."
"The Beekeeper","imseeg","12 January 2024",NA,"I was excited to see a new action movie with Jason Statham (one of my favorite ACTION actors) and although his figting scenes are still okay (ish), they weren't exhilirating. But there is something worse...The bad: Jason Statham (although in a leading role) doesnt get much screen time. A lot of the time we ONLY get to see a bunch of bland FBI agents, who arent impressing me in any way with their subpar acting performances.Nor do these FBI agents come across as credible by the way, constantly missing Jason Statham when they have all the time and opportunity to kill him point blank. Quite silly.More bad: the other supporting actors are really bad though, But they (AS WELL) do get a lot of screentime. So annoying.Not any good? Actor Jeremy Irons nails it. He plays the role of a cunning sophisticated bad guy and he is terrific. But what the heck is the distinguished and superb actor Jeremy Irons doing in such a cheap looking action movie? HE is the only redeeming feature of this movie though, besides a few action scenes with Jason Statham.Jason Statham fans beware, this one is quite a dud. Tedious, lame, uneventful."

Infact the worst part of the film isn't how repetitive and boring the action gets (where Statham is practically untouchable). But the cringey push to make ex-military beekeeper tough guys a thing. You'll definitely get some laughs from how ridiculous it all is. But half the time I couldn't really tell if they were intentional laughs or not.I guess there is enough decent action. Like the farm scene, the middle office attack, and there's a decent brutal fight scene near the end. But even the most promising part of the movie - setting up the great villian for a well deserved ass kicking later. Doesn't pay off. So overall, pretty poor."
"The Beekeeper","banzoozalreviews","12 January 2024",NA,"David Ayer's ""The Beekeeper"" has Jason Statham going full John Wick and full Equalizer. This movie is 90 odd minutes of relentless, unhinged, pure escapist fun, with Statham doing what he does best - taking out bad guys like it's nothing and looking uber cool while doing it. He does that here in spades, in the most brutal and ridiculously entertaining ways. Yes, you need to throw believability aside, but if you are a fan of 80s and 90s action thrillers where it's one man against all, you will love this, just like I did. This movie really was a blast and a half, and then some. A great way to start 2024 movie season. I loved it. Pure escapist entertainment."

The final boss fight was decent, but not over the top enough to be memorable.Overall, this is a poorly made film that you will forget the moment you finish it. It's barely watchable, but I deducted points for plagiarism."
"The Beekeeper","sbweightman","12 January 2024",NA,"A really enjoyable revenge action film full of fast paced action and corny bee-related dialogue. Although the character's backstory has been done many times before, the plot has some modern ideas and modern villains which are easy to hate and the strong moral message was quite refreshing. Good acting from a good cast of characters and whilst some of the henchmen are a bit silly, their larger than life presence adds some surprises into what is otherwise pretty standard fare. Good pacing, music and fight scenes keep it entertaining throughout, although the start is pretty slow and the ending rather abrupt."
"The Beekeeper","olcare","10 January 2024",NA,"I mean, I don't know what to say; it feels like the movie's script was randomly written without any thought. The events are so poorly explained that I couldn't believe it while watching. I have no idea how they shot it. I'm addressing everyone who watched and gave good ratings: watch it again, life is not that simple.I want to mention Jason Statham. The only good thing in the movie is Jason. He is more than an actor; he's an excellent athlete, continuing this for years and elevating all the action scenes in every action movie. In some fight scenes in this film, extras stand there taking hits flatly, and it's entirely the fault of those who planned the scenes.There's no recognizable plot; the character just walks straight into the president of some made-up country's house, kills 30 people, and we watch this for 1 hour and 40 minutes. The FBI is portrayed as if it's a village organization; the detectives hang out like it's their dad's farm. It's unbelievable. They wrote a movie without sitting down and thinking about these details; it's astonishing.The Beekeeper program is constantly mentioned in the film, but what is it? What do these people do? How were they trained? What hardships did they endure? None of it is there; they just expect us to believe in a name. There's nothing about how the top-secret deadly agents of the government are trained.Money theft and the presidential race are portrayed like child's play. These are not people you can easily reach; to blow up a building or enter the president's mansion, you need an incredibly good script, and this film has none of that.The acting is also bad, except for Jason Statham. There's no good performance except him. The character's motivation is bad too; killing 100 people because a woman who treated him well while beekeeping shot herself. We should have seen a 3-5 minute segment about their intimacy.I don't know what else to say; it just goes on and on, complete bulls**t. I'm thinking about David Ayer's early works, and nowadays, each film he makes is dragging everything further down. The screenwriter, Kurt Wimmer, has also messed up; he wrote it thoughtlessly. I'm eagerly anticipating the film's complete failure at the box office. Definitely a waste of time.."
"The Beekeeper","UniqueParticle","11 January 2024",NA,"So glad I got to see an early screening in imax on 1-6-24 just couldn't review yet.

The writing is magnificent too Kurt Whimmer is perfect for in depth action extravaganza.For an autistic person that's been scammed numerous times Beekeeper hit the spot; I absolutely loved the way everything played out.

It was unwatchable, I stayed in the cinema because I had my little brother with me, and wouldn't be rude and interfere with the other people in the cinema.This movies gets -3/10Way too cheesy and cringe. David Ayer this is a redo, better luck next time. My sincere condolences for the people watching.Just another movie for the money, so sad."
"The Beekeeper","petercarlsson-92297","30 January 2024",NA,"Jason Statham does the same movie - again - that he's been doing the last 20 years. This time without a script. They just stacked a number of fight and action scenes on top of each other, then called it a movie.Statham has done a few rather good movies like this. For example ""Homefront"". That movie had a script and good acting. But this... What is this? Is it made for teenage boys? For adults? For girls? Boys? I don't know, but the result is nothing new, nothing thrilling and nothing fun.So what do we got. Well, that's a really good question. The problem is that there's very, very hard to find a good answer."
"The Beekeeper","Brillfury","13 January 2024",NA,"Look,I love a good action flick as much as anyone, and Jason Statham is usually awesome. But sadly director David Ayer delivers what will probably be one of the worst movies of 2024. Ayer made one great movie over 20 years ago (Training Day) and also delivered a good flick in Fury, but everything else he makes is horrible. I will admit I did get a kick out of how dumb and goofy this movie is, and laughed a lot. Statham's character is like a cardboard box, it's so boring. Yes his fighting scenes are very cool but he's played awesome characters before that also had a bit of kick. In this movie he gives us nothing.Phylicia Rashad looks fabulous and gets about 5 minutes of screen time. Jeremy Irons and Josh Hutcherson do a great job but their talents are wasted in this movie.The plot starts out really promising...who wouldn't love to see a revenge action movie where the evil call centers get justice? But sadly the premise is wasted.Oh if you love hearing the word ""Beekeeper"" and references to bees you'll love this.The dialogue in this movie is so corny. It's almost like a satire of action movies at some points.In David Ayer's world, nothing works like it actually does in the real world. It is so goofy the way he portrays everything. And this is something he does in a lot of his movies. Just dumb fictional versions of everything from presidents to agencies to how classified programs work. But I do understand they have to make movies and sometimes make everything really stupid to be entertaining. But this movie takes the cake. For instance, call center scams are a real thing and there are many YouTube videos showing how they operate. But in this movie, the call center office is the most over the top clown spectacle you'll ever see and the actual scam is a ludicrous fictionalized version of how they actually work.The two main FBI agents are portrayed goofy AF and their dialogue is nearly unbearable.Statham's character, the beekeeper, doesn't want you to steal from old people but he has no qualms with murdering about 50 federal law enforcement officers in the course of the movie without batting an eye.So if you are about 13 years old this movie will be the coolest thing you've seen but anywhere over that and it's just too dumb. Maybe when it's on streaming it might be fun to watch and make fun of on a rainy day."
"The Beekeeper","TheNamelessCzar","27 January 2024",NA,"This may be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in the theater. I should've known better knowing I was going to see a Jason Statham movie. He has no talent, and he simply is known for his name and his action/fighting skills. But the reviews were so good! Apparently, the reviewers were paid off. The plot is ridiculous, and the acting skills were as bad as a high school drama club,. At times, I felt like I was watching ann episode of NOVA learning all sorts of things about bees. Statham has one facial expression in the movie, and it looks like boredom. Never again will I see on of his movie sin the theater... I'll wait to bore myself at home when it comes on streaming instead."
"The Beekeeper","masonsaul","13 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper isn't as tight or condensed as the films it borrows from thanks to an unexpectedly dense mythology but it really delivers where it counts. It's essentially Jason Statham beating people up for 100 minutes and it never gets old. Thankfully it doesn't really sequel bait however more of these would definitely be welcome.Jason Statham is never bad even when he's in a dud like a few of his recent films. Even so, it's nice to see his talent and physicality employed in something actually good. Jeremy Irons has the ability to deliver exposition about beekeeping in an engaging manner and Josh Hutcherson is actually awake for this one.Similarly to Statham, David Ayer has had a few misses so it's equally rewarding to see him back doing what he knows best whilst showing he and his team are really good at hand to hand combat. The score by David Sardy & Jared Michael Fry is a huge part of why this works, treating the dumbest twists with the utmost seriousness."
"The Beekeeper","masonfisk","30 January 2024",NA,"The first film of the year may rank as one of the worst for the same as Jason Statham kicks butts & takes names (or is it the other way around?) in this goofy revenge tale. Statham, a former government operative, has retired plying his trade running an apiary on a retired woman's property, Phylicia Rashad, but after she commits suicide after being ripped off by some internet sharks prompting Statham to spew bad bee puns while he kills his way to the top (or bottom, these people are scum!) in a concern which runs right to the heights of the White House as the president's, Gemma Redgrave, (from Howard's End) son, played by Josh Hutcherson, is raking in millions from duped customers which will not stand as far as Statham is concerned. David Ayer, a mismatched director for this material (was Shane Black busy?), directs a particularly goofy premise from scenarist David Wimmer, does not help a whit w/humorless Statham doing the physical lifting w/o any issues but the unintentional guffaws generated from villains who look like extras from The Terminator's Tech-noir dance club scene makes this memorable outing for the wrong reasons. Also starring Oscar winner Jeremy Irons as Redgrave's handler, Oscar nominee Minnie Driver (wasted frankly!) as a government contact & Emmy Raver-Lampman (from The Umbrella Academy) who plays Rashad's daughter."
"The Beekeeper","timeblank","21 January 2024",NA,"I fell victim to a scam, and it's satisfying to see scammers getting their due in the Beekeeper movie. Jason Statham's action-packed destruction of the building and culprits is glorious. Despite the absurd plot, the theme of justice prevails. The constant investigation of Statham's crimes is annoying, and the movie's direction raises many questions. The initial 30 minutes were captivating, but the eventual disappointment left me perplexed. Nonetheless, I still enjoyed the movie, even with its absurdities.Beekeeper seems like a John Wick movie - I acknowledge the similarities, but it's purely for entertainment, nothing beyond that!"
"The Beekeeper","slydon13","21 January 2024",NA,"When you see the opening credits - Minnie Driver, Jeremy Irons and Phylicia Rashad - the possiblity exists that this could be worth watching. Ms Driver only had the 2 scenes so she didn't have to be paid as much to surrender her dignity to keep a straight face . Jeremy Irons had to work much harder.The target audience is presumably teenage boys who don't expect or need a script. I presume the 3 actors named above where offered ridiculous money to be part of this enterprise. They are the comprobable film to the Hallmark Christmas movie (with everything pretty much similar to the cookie cutter used for all the previous examples )Presumably they had X number of required explosions , Y in the stunt crew, calculated Z as the number of scenes with a few gaps for words (lets not call it a script)The industry needs these kind of 'Expendeble' wholy forgettable flic to fill in.I only went to see this because I had a free ticket and if I had actually PAID money to see this, I'd likely be angry at my choice or disappointed.There are lots of better old films from the 30s, 40s, 50 etc . This was a waste of time but my autistic nephew loves going to the cinema and I'm part of his 'entertainment team'."

"The Beekeeper","samyakrout-65994","24 January 2024",NA,"The only good part the stealth and fitness of Jason Statham.This movie is so bad that where to start. Ofcourse the story didn't delayed and started immediately with a scam and then Jason went on killing spree.The first few actions were a bit relatable and ok but then the story became from good to bad and then worse when the president of USA showed up and the secret service could not even did the job they always were regarded as highly and that js to secure and save the president. No character building and not much of investigation.Its a one man show and the most irritating were those two FBI agents who for no reason were cracking boring jokes on each other and eve though they had chances but never cared to shoot him.The main villain who is again another immature gen z character who js always high on drugs was easily having drugs within the presidential house and killed the fbi director as if nothing to worry about.Damn boring boring and repetitive. All characters were so boring and irritable in nature.The best scene was the ending when i left my seat."
"The Beekeeper","chenp-54708","12 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper is one of those dumb stupid action movies that are so ridiculously dumb, yet still has some strong parts. Director David Ayer isn't a filmmaker I really like but I have enjoyed a few of his works like Training Day and End of Watch. His previous movie The Tax Collector was absolutely atrocious but The Beekeeper is slightly better than his last movie.Many of the action thrills, stunts, moments and scenes were ridiculous but for the most part, well-executed and shot pretty well. Although with some mix of poor editing and bad uses of CGI. All the performances were okay as Jason Statham still plays himself but still the fun aspect of the movie. The narrative is pretty ridiculous and kind of dumb where the more you think about it, the more dumber it becomes. The style definitely takes a bit too much influence on the John Wick series and some of the dialogue is quite laughable. But hey, all in all, I did enjoy some moments because it clearly doesn't take itself too seriously and the actions, thrills and Statham being himself was pretty fun."
"The Beekeeper","kmkevinn-64733","12 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper buzzes with intensity as it unveils a gripping tale of vengeance that transcends personal vendettas to impact an entire nation. The film takes you on a relentless journey with one man, a former operative of the enigmatic 'Beekeepers.' What begins as a brutal campaign for personal justice quickly escalates into a high-stakes thriller with national consequences. The storytelling is a masterclass maybe mediocre in suspense, weaving a web of intrigue and unveiling layers of a clandestine organization. The protagonist's journey from a solitary avenger to a player in a larger, more dangerous game is both compelling, almost average and chilling. The Beekeeper delivers not only on the promise of riveting action but also explores the shadowy realms of power and conspiracy, making it a must-watch for any fans of gripping thrillers with a touch of espionage intrigue. The 6/10 is appropriate."
"The Beekeeper","DocteurDream","30 January 2024",NA,"Verona Parker is easily one of the worst characters ever written for the screen, takes away everything this movie aspires to be. The actress also did a piss poor job and always had me cringing at the unrealistic and unreasonable choices she makes. If you'd delete that character entirely, this movie would've been a whole lot better in the long run.Subject wise it's a very nice concept of a revenge thriller against scam call centers- but again, the whole govt mumbo jumbo makes it feel a whole run of the mill action BS from Hollywood mid tier movies. If the story had been awhole lot grounded, it would've done a whole lot better imo."
"The Beekeeper","kjproulx","12 January 2024",NA,"By now, audiences should realize what they are in for when it comes to Jason Statham leading an action film. The Beekeeper is the latest film to continue his long-running legacy of action flicks and it's quite a bit of fun. It's very far from an awards nominee, but for a film I had zero expectations for, and for being as cheesy as it is, it's pretty good. Take that as you will because I will be diving into things that are also pretty bad as well. The cheesiness of this film will turn some people off, but I was able to ignore it. Here's why I recommend The Beekeeper if you want to watch a new action-packed film to enjoy and not have to think too much about.The ""Beekeepers"" is an organization of hitmen who take out criminals. Jason Statham plays Adam Clay, a retiree from this organization, who is on a manhunt for everyone involved in scamming a woman he cared for, which led to her suicide. It's as simple as that. There are multiple bosses in this company, so it's like watching a sophisticated video game being played out. The action sequences are well-choreographed and there are quite a few action scenes, so overall, this film was a blast to watch. With that said, the dialogue from beginning to end it pretty atrocious.If the script had been reworked, I think this could've been a surprisingly great film as a whole. Sadly, the dialogue is full of Bee puns that fall flat almost every time, even with solid actors delivering them. The character arc and dialogue for Josh Hutcherson's Derek Danforth (who is the main villain of the film) is laughable, and not really in a good way. His whiny, self-entitled performance was great and I liked that he was giving this character his all, it's just that, again, the dialogue sucks. The lines everyone was saying took me out of the experience many times. Still, there is a lot of great action, and that's what I wanted from a movie like this anyway. I'm sure the dialogue will have people hating this movie and I'm equally sure certain people will find it hilarious. I'm kind of in the middle.The Beekeeper is David Ayer's latest directorial effort and as always, he does a great job with action. His touch as a director is always welcomed by me and the neon look to the film was cool as well. It's a cool film to watch and it's aesthetically pleasing. I may be ripping apart the script, but it's just the dialogue. The story itself plays out nicely and has a nice resolution. I was looking for a fun action film and this film delivered that, despite its downfalls. I say check it out."
"The Beekeeper","FeastMode","12 January 2024",NA,"I seem to use that headline a lot. I guess it's better than a bad movie with bad fight scenes.Starting with the good, Statham is awesome as usual. And I loved all of the fight scenes. They are ridiculously fast yet completely clear. It's hard hitting, you can feel the blows. This is enhanced by the beastly IMAX speakers. And with the R-rating, it doesn't hold back. Although it's far from gratuitous.The bad? Sigh. The non-action scenes, which make up the majority of the movie, range from average to terrible. The quality level feels like a streaming movie, not a theatrical one. I spent much of the runtime uninterested and unengaged.Everything feels off. The dialogue is weird. The acting is questionable. And there are a bunch of dumb things that strain believability. Like the entire bad guy organization. Or a laugh-out-loud idiotic character decision during the climax. A true ""are you kidding me?"" moment.Even the cut to credits felt odd. Like the director just cut in the middle of a shot and said, ""screw it, let's go home.""(1 viewing, early screening UltraScreen 1/6/2024)"
"The Beekeeper","Neptune165","2 February 2024",NA,"Just when you think we have reached the bottom of filmmaking ... there is always something like this flick just to prove you can do a lot worse! It s so bland. The FBI agent was not professional and dressed and sounded dumb, lost mom by suicidal act and that did not play much of a roll after the incident,, the villains sounded stupid, especially the dip shots from the call centers. The story idea was great, Jason was awesome but the rest of the actors failed to bring it home. This movie is a terrible revenge story. The idea that Beekeepers are the most elite, well-trained, best equipped one man army is so over-used. The most unbelievable part is that he is hunted by mercenaries, law enforcement, and other Beekeepers. The acting is terrible, the storyline is worse."
"The Beekeeper","BA_Harrison","12 January 2024",NA,"After Fast X and The Meg 2, I swore I wouldn't waste any more of my time on Jason Statham movies, but the trailer for The Beekeeper looked good, so I thought I would give him one last chance. I just hoped that I wouldn't get stung again.Thankfully, this action flick from director David Ayer is as sweet as honey: it's unpretentious, over-the-top, gloriously violent nonsense that isn't to be taken seriously... the film is all about how many people the star can kill or maim during the 1hr 45minute runtime (the answer: a lot!).Statham plays Adam Clay, a beekeeper in more ways than one: he looks after bee hives on the farm owned by kindly Eloise Parker (Phylicia Rashad), but he's also a retired special operative known as a 'beekeeper', part of a government programme so secret even the FBI doesn't know about it. When Eloise loses all of her savings to scammers and commits suicide, Adam isn't a happy man and goes after those responsible, the trail leading all the way to the President of the United States (Jemma Redgrave).Buildings are blown up, limbs are broken, body parts are severed, people are shot, but Adam barely gets a scratch -- those looking for realism should look elsewhere. There's even a scene where a female beekeeper uses a mini-gun mounted on the back of a truck, and mini-guns always equal fun.At the end of the day, Adam makes the bad guys pay for their crimes, and promptly escapes, presumably to set up some more bee hives (the villains having shot up his earlier ones) and to prepare for the inevitable sequel."
"The Beekeeper","imseeg","12 January 2024",NA,"I was excited to see a new action movie with Jason Statham (one of my favorite ACTION actors) and although his figting scenes are still okay (ish), they weren't exhilirating. But there is something worse...The bad: Jason Statham (although in a leading role) doesnt get much screen time. A lot of the time we ONLY get to see a bunch of bland FBI agents, who arent impressing me in any way with their subpar acting performances.Nor do these FBI agents come across as credible by the way, constantly missing Jason Statham when they have all the time and opportunity to kill him point blank. Quite silly.More bad: the other supporting actors are really bad though, But they (AS WELL) do get a lot of screentime. So annoying.Not any good? Actor Jeremy Irons nails it. He plays the role of a cunning sophisticated bad guy and he is terrific. But what the heck is the distinguished and superb actor Jeremy Irons doing in such a cheap looking action movie? HE is the only redeeming feature of this movie though, besides a few action scenes with Jason Statham.Jason Statham fans beware, this one is quite a dud. Tedious, lame, uneventful."
"The Beekeeper","Xavier_Stone","10 January 2024",NA,"Written by Kurt Wimmer who is known for The Expendables which seems about right. Nearly all action which was ok, yet the story is just trash. If you're a fan of Jason then this one is just another average film with his stunts and fighting.Other than that the movie lacks any seriousness and the law enforcement roles are comical and everyone just comes out looking like keystone cops. It could have been so much better with a decent director and a lot of tweaks in the script.Sadly, not enough going on here to please anything but the Jason fans. 3 stars for action, zero for everything else. Even the ending is a zero. Park your brain before watching, no thinking required."
"The Beekeeper","martinrobertson300482","28 January 2024",NA,"Not sure why i went to see this one as i've not seen most of Jason Stathams movies. And if they're anything like this one i won't be in a rush to revisit them.The movie looked dumb, and it is. Statham is a beekeeper. Both metaphorically and genuinely. Infact the worst part of the film isn't how repetitive and boring the action gets (where Statham is practically untouchable). But the cringey push to make ex-military beekeeper tough guys a thing. You'll definitely get some laughs from how ridiculous it all is. But half the time I couldn't really tell if they were intentional laughs or not.I guess there is enough decent action. Like the farm scene, the middle office attack, and there's a decent brutal fight scene near the end. But even the most promising part of the movie - setting up the great villian for a well deserved ass kicking later. Doesn't pay off. So overall, pretty poor."
"The Beekeeper","banzoozalreviews","12 January 2024",NA,"David Ayer's ""The Beekeeper"" has Jason Statham going full John Wick and full Equalizer. This movie is 90 odd minutes of relentless, unhinged, pure escapist fun, with Statham doing what he does best - taking out bad guys like it's nothing and looking uber cool while doing it. He does that here in spades, in the most brutal and ridiculously entertaining ways. Yes, you need to throw believability aside, but if you are a fan of 80s and 90s action thrillers where it's one man against all, you will love this, just like I did. This movie really was a blast and a half, and then some. A great way to start 2024 movie season. I loved it. Pure escapist entertainment."
"The Beekeeper","kuner-59029","14 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper attempts to copy the John Wick formula to the point of plagiarism.The setup is virtually the same. Statham, playing himself as usual, is retired and extremely dangerous ex-assassin, member of a secret group called ""Beekeepers"". He get pulled out of retirement over a seemingly minor incident, and the conflict escalates.A woman he sells honey to (played by the mom from the Cosby Show) commits suicide after having her savings stolen by a scammer company.He takes revenge for her, but oh no, the company belongs to the president's no-good son (similar to the Russian Mob boss's son in the John Wick original).He fights his way to the top through many neon-lit setpieces until he reaches the final boss. The end.However, unlike John Wick, there is none of the fascinating world building, none of the flair, none of the great music editing, much of the acting is awful, and so the whole thing comes apart at the seams. Tonally, the film never hits the mark. Scenes variate between overacted and ridiculous to boring, slow paced and TV series like. Every time the narrative switches to a female FBI agent, the air is sucked out of the movie, and energy comes to a grinding halt.The use of music is awful. It alternates between Batman knock off cello and contrabass strings, which don't fit at all, to house and electronic in scenes where it doesn't fit either. It worked in John Wick, because it was woven into the story. John Wick was either in a night club, or the music was played on the Assassin's radio station. Here it just comes out of nowhere.There are a few good kills. The car off the drawbridge early on is excellent. The final boss fight was decent, but not over the top enough to be memorable.Overall, this is a poorly made film that you will forget the moment you finish it. It's barely watchable, but I deducted points for plagiarism."

"The Beekeeper","petercarlsson-92297","30 January 2024",NA,"Jason Statham does the same movie - again - that he's been doing the last 20 years. This time without a script. They just stacked a number of fight and action scenes on top of each other, then called it a movie.Statham has done a few rather good movies like this. For example ""Homefront"". That movie had a script and good acting. But this... What is this? Is it made for teenage boys? For adults? For girls? Boys? I don't know, but the result is nothing new, nothing thrilling and nothing fun.So what do we got. Well, that's a really good question. The problem is that there's very, very hard to find a good answer."
"The Beekeeper","Brillfury","13 January 2024",NA,"Look,I love a good action flick as much as anyone, and Jason Statham is usually awesome. But sadly director David Ayer delivers what will probably be one of the worst movies of 2024. Ayer made one great movie over 20 years ago (Training Day) and also delivered a good flick in Fury, but everything else he makes is horrible. I will admit I did get a kick out of how dumb and goofy this movie is, and laughed a lot. Statham's character is like a cardboard box, it's so boring. Yes his fighting scenes are very cool but he's played awesome characters before that also had a bit of kick. In this movie he gives us nothing.Phylicia Rashad looks fabulous and gets about 5 minutes of screen time. Jeremy Irons and Josh Hutcherson do a great job but their talents are wasted in this movie.The plot starts out really promising...who wouldn't love to see a revenge action movie where the evil call centers get justice? But sadly the premise is wasted.Oh if you love hearing the word ""Beekeeper"" and references to bees you'll love this.The dialogue in this movie is so corny. It's almost like a satire of action movies at some points.In David Ayer's world, nothing works like it actually does in the real world. It is so goofy the way he portrays everything. And this is something he does in a lot of his movies. Just dumb fictional versions of everything from presidents to agencies to how classified programs work. But I do understand they have to make movies and sometimes make everything really stupid to be entertaining. But this movie takes the cake. For instance, call center scams are a real thing and there are many YouTube videos showing how they operate. But in this movie, the call center office is the most over the top clown spectacle you'll ever see and the actual scam is a ludicrous fictionalized version of how they actually work.The two main FBI agents are portrayed goofy AF and their dialogue is nearly unbearable.Statham's character, the beekeeper, doesn't want you to steal from old people but he has no qualms with murdering about 50 federal law enforcement officers in the course of the movie without batting an eye.So if you are about 13 years old this movie will be the coolest thing you've seen but anywhere over that and it's just too dumb. Maybe when it's on streaming it might be fun to watch and make fun of on a rainy day."
"The Beekeeper","TheNamelessCzar","27 January 2024",NA,"This may be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in the theater. I should've known better knowing I was going to see a Jason Statham movie. He has no talent, and he simply is known for his name and his action/fighting skills. But the reviews were so good! Apparently, the reviewers were paid off. The plot is ridiculous, and the acting skills were as bad as a high school drama club,. At times, I felt like I was watching ann episode of NOVA learning all sorts of things about bees. Statham has one facial expression in the movie, and it looks like boredom. Never again will I see on of his movie sin the theater... I'll wait to bore myself at home when it comes on streaming instead."
"The Beekeeper","masonsaul","13 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper isn't as tight or condensed as the films it borrows from thanks to an unexpectedly dense mythology but it really delivers where it counts. It's essentially Jason Statham beating people up for 100 minutes and it never gets old. Thankfully it doesn't really sequel bait however more of these would definitely be welcome.Jason Statham is never bad even when he's in a dud like a few of his recent films. Even so, it's nice to see his talent and physicality employed in something actually good. Jeremy Irons has the ability to deliver exposition about beekeeping in an engaging manner and Josh Hutcherson is actually awake for this one.Similarly to Statham, David Ayer has had a few misses so it's equally rewarding to see him back doing what he knows best whilst showing he and his team are really good at hand to hand combat. The score by David Sardy & Jared Michael Fry is a huge part of why this works, treating the dumbest twists with the utmost seriousness."
"The Beekeeper","masonfisk","30 January 2024",NA,"The first film of the year may rank as one of the worst for the same as Jason Statham kicks butts & takes names (or is it the other way around?) in this goofy revenge tale. Statham, a former government operative, has retired plying his trade running an apiary on a retired woman's property, Phylicia Rashad, but after she commits suicide after being ripped off by some internet sharks prompting Statham to spew bad bee puns while he kills his way to the top (or bottom, these people are scum!) in a concern which runs right to the heights of the White House as the president's, Gemma Redgrave, (from Howard's End) son, played by Josh Hutcherson, is raking in millions from duped customers which will not stand as far as Statham is concerned. David Ayer, a mismatched director for this material (was Shane Black busy?), directs a particularly goofy premise from scenarist David Wimmer, does not help a whit w/humorless Statham doing the physical lifting w/o any issues but the unintentional guffaws generated from villains who look like extras from The Terminator's Tech-noir dance club scene makes this memorable outing for the wrong reasons. Also starring Oscar winner Jeremy Irons as Redgrave's handler, Oscar nominee Minnie Driver (wasted frankly!) as a government contact & Emmy Raver-Lampman (from The Umbrella Academy) who plays Rashad's daughter."
"The Beekeeper","timeblank","21 January 2024",NA,"I fell victim to a scam, and it's satisfying to see scammers getting their due in the Beekeeper movie. Jason Statham's action-packed destruction of the building and culprits is glorious. Despite the absurd plot, the theme of justice prevails. The constant investigation of Statham's crimes is annoying, and the movie's direction raises many questions. The initial 30 minutes were captivating, but the eventual disappointment left me perplexed. Nonetheless, I still enjoyed the movie, even with its absurdities.Beekeeper seems like a John Wick movie - I acknowledge the similarities, but it's purely for entertainment, nothing beyond that!"
"The Beekeeper","slydon13","21 January 2024",NA,"When you see the opening credits - Minnie Driver, Jeremy Irons and Phylicia Rashad - the possiblity exists that this could be worth watching. Ms Driver only had the 2 scenes so she didn't have to be paid as much to surrender her dignity to keep a straight face . Jeremy Irons had to work much harder.The target audience is presumably teenage boys who don't expect or need a script. I presume the 3 actors named above where offered ridiculous money to be part of this enterprise. They are the comprobable film to the Hallmark Christmas movie (with everything pretty much similar to the cookie cutter used for all the previous examples )Presumably they had X number of required explosions , Y in the stunt crew, calculated Z as the number of scenes with a few gaps for words (lets not call it a script)The industry needs these kind of 'Expendeble' wholy forgettable flic to fill in.I only went to see this because I had a free ticket and if I had actually PAID money to see this, I'd likely be angry at my choice or disappointed.There are lots of better old films from the 30s, 40s, 50 etc . This was a waste of time but my autistic nephew loves going to the cinema and I'm part of his 'entertainment team'."

"The Beekeeper","samyakrout-65994","24 January 2024",NA,"The only good part the stealth and fitness of Jason Statham.This movie is so bad that where to start. Ofcourse the story didn't delayed and started immediately with a scam and then Jason went on killing spree.The first few actions were a bit relatable and ok but then the story became from good to bad and then worse when the president of USA showed up and the secret service could not even did the job they always were regarded as highly and that js to secure and save the president. No character building and not much of investigation.Its a one man show and the most irritating were those two FBI agents who for no reason were cracking boring jokes on each other and eve though they had chances but never cared to shoot him.The main villain who is again another immature gen z character who js always high on drugs was easily having drugs within the presidential house and killed the fbi director as if nothing to worry about.Damn boring boring and repetitive. All characters were so boring and irritable in nature.The best scene was the ending when i left my seat."
"The Beekeeper","chenp-54708","12 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper is one of those dumb stupid action movies that are so ridiculously dumb, yet still has some strong parts. Director David Ayer isn't a filmmaker I really like but I have enjoyed a few of his works like Training Day and End of Watch. His previous movie The Tax Collector was absolutely atrocious but The Beekeeper is slightly better than his last movie.Many of the action thrills, stunts, moments and scenes were ridiculous but for the most part, well-executed and shot pretty well. Although with some mix of poor editing and bad uses of CGI. All the performances were okay as Jason Statham still plays himself but still the fun aspect of the movie. The narrative is pretty ridiculous and kind of dumb where the more you think about it, the more dumber it becomes. The style definitely takes a bit too much influence on the John Wick series and some of the dialogue is quite laughable. But hey, all in all, I did enjoy some moments because it clearly doesn't take itself too seriously and the actions, thrills and Statham being himself was pretty fun."
"The Beekeeper","kmkevinn-64733","12 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper buzzes with intensity as it unveils a gripping tale of vengeance that transcends personal vendettas to impact an entire nation. The film takes you on a relentless journey with one man, a former operative of the enigmatic 'Beekeepers.' What begins as a brutal campaign for personal justice quickly escalates into a high-stakes thriller with national consequences. The storytelling is a masterclass maybe mediocre in suspense, weaving a web of intrigue and unveiling layers of a clandestine organization. The protagonist's journey from a solitary avenger to a player in a larger, more dangerous game is both compelling, almost average and chilling. The Beekeeper delivers not only on the promise of riveting action but also explores the shadowy realms of power and conspiracy, making it a must-watch for any fans of gripping thrillers with a touch of espionage intrigue. The 6/10 is appropriate."
"The Beekeeper","DocteurDream","30 January 2024",NA,"Verona Parker is easily one of the worst characters ever written for the screen, takes away everything this movie aspires to be. The actress also did a piss poor job and always had me cringing at the unrealistic and unreasonable choices she makes. If you'd delete that character entirely, this movie would've been a whole lot better in the long run.Subject wise it's a very nice concept of a revenge thriller against scam call centers- but again, the whole govt mumbo jumbo makes it feel a whole run of the mill action BS from Hollywood mid tier movies. If the story had been awhole lot grounded, it would've done a whole lot better imo."
"The Beekeeper","kjproulx","12 January 2024",NA,"By now, audiences should realize what they are in for when it comes to Jason Statham leading an action film. The Beekeeper is the latest film to continue his long-running legacy of action flicks and it's quite a bit of fun. It's very far from an awards nominee, but for a film I had zero expectations for, and for being as cheesy as it is, it's pretty good. Take that as you will because I will be diving into things that are also pretty bad as well. The cheesiness of this film will turn some people off, but I was able to ignore it. Here's why I recommend The Beekeeper if you want to watch a new action-packed film to enjoy and not have to think too much about.The ""Beekeepers"" is an organization of hitmen who take out criminals. Jason Statham plays Adam Clay, a retiree from this organization, who is on a manhunt for everyone involved in scamming a woman he cared for, which led to her suicide. It's as simple as that. There are multiple bosses in this company, so it's like watching a sophisticated video game being played out. The action sequences are well-choreographed and there are quite a few action scenes, so overall, this film was a blast to watch. With that said, the dialogue from beginning to end it pretty atrocious.If the script had been reworked, I think this could've been a surprisingly great film as a whole. Sadly, the dialogue is full of Bee puns that fall flat almost every time, even with solid actors delivering them. The character arc and dialogue for Josh Hutcherson's Derek Danforth (who is the main villain of the film) is laughable, and not really in a good way. His whiny, self-entitled performance was great and I liked that he was giving this character his all, it's just that, again, the dialogue sucks. The lines everyone was saying took me out of the experience many times. Still, there is a lot of great action, and that's what I wanted from a movie like this anyway. I'm sure the dialogue will have people hating this movie and I'm equally sure certain people will find it hilarious. I'm kind of in the middle.The Beekeeper is David Ayer's latest directorial effort and as always, he does a great job with action. His touch as a director is always welcomed by me and the neon look to the film was cool as well. It's a cool film to watch and it's aesthetically pleasing. I may be ripping apart the script, but it's just the dialogue. The story itself plays out nicely and has a nice resolution. I was looking for a fun action film and this film delivered that, despite its downfalls. I say check it out."
"The Beekeeper","FeastMode","12 January 2024",NA,"I seem to use that headline a lot. I guess it's better than a bad movie with bad fight scenes.Starting with the good, Statham is awesome as usual. And I loved all of the fight scenes. They are ridiculously fast yet completely clear. It's hard hitting, you can feel the blows. This is enhanced by the beastly IMAX speakers. And with the R-rating, it doesn't hold back. Although it's far from gratuitous.The bad? Sigh. The non-action scenes, which make up the majority of the movie, range from average to terrible. The quality level feels like a streaming movie, not a theatrical one. I spent much of the runtime uninterested and unengaged.Everything feels off. The dialogue is weird. The acting is questionable. And there are a bunch of dumb things that strain believability. Like the entire bad guy organization. Or a laugh-out-loud idiotic character decision during the climax. A true ""are you kidding me?"" moment.Even the cut to credits felt odd. Like the director just cut in the middle of a shot and said, ""screw it, let's go home.""(1 viewing, early screening UltraScreen 1/6/2024)"
"The Beekeeper","Neptune165","2 February 2024",NA,"Just when you think we have reached the bottom of filmmaking ... there is always something like this flick just to prove you can do a lot worse! It s so bland. The FBI agent was not professional and dressed and sounded dumb, lost mom by suicidal act and that did not play much of a roll after the incident,, the villains sounded stupid, especially the dip shots from the call centers. The story idea was great, Jason was awesome but the rest of the actors failed to bring it home. This movie is a terrible revenge story. The idea that Beekeepers are the most elite, well-trained, best equipped one man army is so over-used. The most unbelievable part is that he is hunted by mercenaries, law enforcement, and other Beekeepers. The acting is terrible, the storyline is worse."
"The Beekeeper","BA_Harrison","12 January 2024",NA,"After Fast X and The Meg 2, I swore I wouldn't waste any more of my time on Jason Statham movies, but the trailer for The Beekeeper looked good, so I thought I would give him one last chance. I just hoped that I wouldn't get stung again.Thankfully, this action flick from director David Ayer is as sweet as honey: it's unpretentious, over-the-top, gloriously violent nonsense that isn't to be taken seriously... the film is all about how many people the star can kill or maim during the 1hr 45minute runtime (the answer: a lot!).Statham plays Adam Clay, a beekeeper in more ways than one: he looks after bee hives on the farm owned by kindly Eloise Parker (Phylicia Rashad), but he's also a retired special operative known as a 'beekeeper', part of a government programme so secret even the FBI doesn't know about it. When Eloise loses all of her savings to scammers and commits suicide, Adam isn't a happy man and goes after those responsible, the trail leading all the way to the President of the United States (Jemma Redgrave).Buildings are blown up, limbs are broken, body parts are severed, people are shot, but Adam barely gets a scratch -- those looking for realism should look elsewhere. There's even a scene where a female beekeeper uses a mini-gun mounted on the back of a truck, and mini-guns always equal fun.At the end of the day, Adam makes the bad guys pay for their crimes, and promptly escapes, presumably to set up some more bee hives (the villains having shot up his earlier ones) and to prepare for the inevitable sequel."
"The Beekeeper","imseeg","12 January 2024",NA,"I was excited to see a new action movie with Jason Statham (one of my favorite ACTION actors) and although his figting scenes are still okay (ish), they weren't exhilirating. But there is something worse...The bad: Jason Statham (although in a leading role) doesnt get much screen time. A lot of the time we ONLY get to see a bunch of bland FBI agents, who arent impressing me in any way with their subpar acting performances.Nor do these FBI agents come across as credible by the way, constantly missing Jason Statham when they have all the time and opportunity to kill him point blank. Quite silly.More bad: the other supporting actors are really bad though, But they (AS WELL) do get a lot of screentime. So annoying.Not any good? Actor Jeremy Irons nails it. He plays the role of a cunning sophisticated bad guy and he is terrific. But what the heck is the distinguished and superb actor Jeremy Irons doing in such a cheap looking action movie? HE is the only redeeming feature of this movie though, besides a few action scenes with Jason Statham.Jason Statham fans beware, this one is quite a dud. Tedious, lame, uneventful."
"The Beekeeper","Xavier_Stone","10 January 2024",NA,"Written by Kurt Wimmer who is known for The Expendables which seems about right. Nearly all action which was ok, yet the story is just trash. If you're a fan of Jason then this one is just another average film with his stunts and fighting.Other than that the movie lacks any seriousness and the law enforcement roles are comical and everyone just comes out looking like keystone cops. It could have been so much better with a decent director and a lot of tweaks in the script.Sadly, not enough going on here to please anything but the Jason fans. 3 stars for action, zero for everything else. Even the ending is a zero. Park your brain before watching, no thinking required."
"The Beekeeper","martinrobertson300482","28 January 2024",NA,"Not sure why i went to see this one as i've not seen most of Jason Stathams movies. And if they're anything like this one i won't be in a rush to revisit them.The movie looked dumb, and it is. Statham is a beekeeper. Both metaphorically and genuinely. Infact the worst part of the film isn't how repetitive and boring the action gets (where Statham is practically untouchable). But the cringey push to make ex-military beekeeper tough guys a thing. You'll definitely get some laughs from how ridiculous it all is. But half the time I couldn't really tell if they were intentional laughs or not.I guess there is enough decent action. Like the farm scene, the middle office attack, and there's a decent brutal fight scene near the end. But even the most promising part of the movie - setting up the great villian for a well deserved ass kicking later. Doesn't pay off. So overall, pretty poor."
"The Beekeeper","banzoozalreviews","12 January 2024",NA,"David Ayer's ""The Beekeeper"" has Jason Statham going full John Wick and full Equalizer. This movie is 90 odd minutes of relentless, unhinged, pure escapist fun, with Statham doing what he does best - taking out bad guys like it's nothing and looking uber cool while doing it. He does that here in spades, in the most brutal and ridiculously entertaining ways. Yes, you need to throw believability aside, but if you are a fan of 80s and 90s action thrillers where it's one man against all, you will love this, just like I did. This movie really was a blast and a half, and then some. A great way to start 2024 movie season. I loved it. Pure escapist entertainment."
"The Beekeeper","kuner-59029","14 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper attempts to copy the John Wick formula to the point of plagiarism.The setup is virtually the same. Statham, playing himself as usual, is retired and extremely dangerous ex-assassin, member of a secret group called ""Beekeepers"". He get pulled out of retirement over a seemingly minor incident, and the conflict escalates.A woman he sells honey to (played by the mom from the Cosby Show) commits suicide after having her savings stolen by a scammer company.He takes revenge for her, but oh no, the company belongs to the president's no-good son (similar to the Russian Mob boss's son in the John Wick original).He fights his way to the top through many neon-lit setpieces until he reaches the final boss. The end.However, unlike John Wick, there is none of the fascinating world building, none of the flair, none of the great music editing, much of the acting is awful, and so the whole thing comes apart at the seams. Tonally, the film never hits the mark. Scenes variate between overacted and ridiculous to boring, slow paced and TV series like. Every time the narrative switches to a female FBI agent, the air is sucked out of the movie, and energy comes to a grinding halt.The use of music is awful. It alternates between Batman knock off cello and contrabass strings, which don't fit at all, to house and electronic in scenes where it doesn't fit either. It worked in John Wick, because it was woven into the story. John Wick was either in a night club, or the music was played on the Assassin's radio station. Here it just comes out of nowhere.There are a few good kills. The car off the drawbridge early on is excellent. The final boss fight was decent, but not over the top enough to be memorable.Overall, this is a poorly made film that you will forget the moment you finish it. It's barely watchable, but I deducted points for plagiarism."
"The Beekeeper","sbweightman","12 January 2024",NA,"A really enjoyable revenge action film full of fast paced action and corny bee-related dialogue. Although the character's backstory has been done many times before, the plot has some modern ideas and modern villains which are easy to hate and the strong moral message was quite refreshing. Good acting from a good cast of characters and whilst some of the henchmen are a bit silly, their larger than life presence adds some surprises into what is otherwise pretty standard fare. Good pacing, music and fight scenes keep it entertaining throughout, although the start is pretty slow and the ending rather abrupt."
"The Beekeeper","olcare","10 January 2024",NA,"I mean, I don't know what to say; it feels like the movie's script was randomly written without any thought. The events are so poorly explained that I couldn't believe it while watching. I have no idea how they shot it. I'm addressing everyone who watched and gave good ratings: watch it again, life is not that simple.I want to mention Jason Statham. The only good thing in the movie is Jason. He is more than an actor; he's an excellent athlete, continuing this for years and elevating all the action scenes in every action movie. In some fight scenes in this film, extras stand there taking hits flatly, and it's entirely the fault of those who planned the scenes.There's no recognizable plot; the character just walks straight into the president of some made-up country's house, kills 30 people, and we watch this for 1 hour and 40 minutes. The FBI is portrayed as if it's a village organization; the detectives hang out like it's their dad's farm. It's unbelievable. They wrote a movie without sitting down and thinking about these details; it's astonishing.The Beekeeper program is constantly mentioned in the film, but what is it? What do these people do? How were they trained? What hardships did they endure? None of it is there; they just expect us to believe in a name. There's nothing about how the top-secret deadly agents of the government are trained.Money theft and the presidential race are portrayed like child's play. These are not people you can easily reach; to blow up a building or enter the president's mansion, you need an incredibly good script, and this film has none of that.The acting is also bad, except for Jason Statham. There's no good performance except him. The character's motivation is bad too; killing 100 people because a woman who treated him well while beekeeping shot herself. We should have seen a 3-5 minute segment about their intimacy.I don't know what else to say; it just goes on and on, complete bulls**t. I'm thinking about David Ayer's early works, and nowadays, each film he makes is dragging everything further down. The screenwriter, Kurt Wimmer, has also messed up; he wrote it thoughtlessly. I'm eagerly anticipating the film's complete failure at the box office. Definitely a waste of time.."

I've been a fan of Jason Statham for a couple decades now and this is one of his best.

Thankfully it doesn't really sequel bait however more of these would definitely be welcome.Jason Statham is never bad even when he's in a dud like a few of his recent films. Even so, it's nice to see his talent and physicality employed in something actually good. Jeremy Irons has the ability to deliver exposition about beekeeping in an engaging manner and Josh Hutcherson is actually awake for this one.Similarly to Statham, David Ayer has had a few misses so it's equally rewarding to see him back doing what he knows best whilst showing he and his team are really good at hand to hand combat. The score by David Sardy & Jared Michael Fry is a huge part of why this works, treating the dumbest twists with the utmost seriousness."
"The Beekeeper","masonfisk","30 January 2024",NA,"The first film of the year may rank as one of the worst for the same as Jason Statham kicks butts & takes names (or is it the other way around?) in this goofy revenge tale. Statham, a former government operative, has retired plying his trade running an apiary on a retired woman's property, Phylicia Rashad, but after she commits suicide after being ripped off by some internet sharks prompting Statham to spew bad bee puns while he kills his way to the top (or bottom, these people are scum!) in a concern which runs right to the heights of the White House as the president's, Gemma Redgrave, (from Howard's End) son, played by Josh Hutcherson, is raking in millions from duped customers which will not stand as far as Statham is concerned. David Ayer, a mismatched director for this material (was Shane Black busy?), directs a particularly goofy premise from scenarist David Wimmer, does not help a whit w/humorless Statham doing the physical lifting w/o any issues but the unintentional guffaws generated from villains who look like extras from The Terminator's Tech-noir dance club scene makes this memorable outing for the wrong reasons. Also starring Oscar winner Jeremy Irons as Redgrave's handler, Oscar nominee Minnie Driver (wasted frankly!) as a government contact & Emmy Raver-Lampman (from The Umbrella Academy) who plays Rashad's daughter."

Jason Statham's action-packed destruction of the building and culprits is glorious. Despite the absurd plot, the theme of justice prevails. The constant investigation of Statham's crimes is annoying, and the movie's direction raises many questions. The initial 30 minutes were captivating, but the eventual disappointment left me perplexed.

Ms Driver only had the 2 scenes so she didn't have to be paid as much to surrender her dignity to keep a straight face . Jeremy Irons had to work much harder.The target audience is presumably teenage boys who don't expect or need a script.

They are the comprobable film to the Hallmark Christmas movie (with everything pretty much similar to the cookie cutter used for all the previous examples )Presumably they had X number of required explosions , Y in the stunt crew, calculated Z as the number of scenes with a few gaps for words (lets not call it a script)The industry needs these kind of 'Expendeble' wholy forgettable flic to fill in.I only went to see this because I had a free ticket and if I had actually PAID money to see this, I'd likely be angry at my choice or disappointed.There are lots of better old films from the 30s, 40s, 50 etc .

Ofcourse the story didn't delayed and started immediately with a scam and then Jason went on killing spree.The first few actions were a bit relatable and ok but then the story became from good to bad and then worse when the president of USA showed up and the secret service could not even did the job they always were regarded as highly and that js to secure and save the president. No character building and not much of investigation.Its a one man show and the most irritating were those two FBI agents who for no reason were cracking boring jokes on each other and eve though they had chances but never cared to shoot him.The main villain who is again another immature gen z character who js always high on drugs was easily having drugs within the presidential house and killed the fbi director as if nothing to worry about.Damn boring boring and repetitive.

"The Beekeeper","chenp-54708","12 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper is one of those dumb stupid action movies that are so ridiculously dumb, yet still has some strong parts. Director David Ayer isn't a filmmaker I really like but I have enjoyed a few of his works like Training Day and End of Watch. His previous movie The Tax Collector was absolutely atrocious but The Beekeeper is slightly better than his last movie.Many of the action thrills, stunts, moments and scenes were ridiculous but for the most part, well-executed and shot pretty well. Although with some mix of poor editing and bad uses of CGI. All the performances were okay as Jason Statham still plays himself but still the fun aspect of the movie. The narrative is pretty ridiculous and kind of dumb where the more you think about it, the more dumber it becomes. The style definitely takes a bit too much influence on the John Wick series and some of the dialogue is quite laughable. But hey, all in all, I did enjoy some moments because it clearly doesn't take itself too seriously and the actions, thrills and Statham being himself was pretty fun."
"The Beekeeper","kmkevinn-64733","12 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper buzzes with intensity as it unveils a gripping tale of vengeance that transcends personal vendettas to impact an entire nation. The film takes you on a relentless journey with one man, a former operative of the enigmatic 'Beekeepers.' What begins as a brutal campaign for personal justice quickly escalates into a high-stakes thriller with national consequences. The storytelling is a masterclass maybe mediocre in suspense, weaving a web of intrigue and unveiling layers of a clandestine organization. The protagonist's journey from a solitary avenger to a player in a larger, more dangerous game is both compelling, almost average and chilling. The Beekeeper delivers not only on the promise of riveting action but also explores the shadowy realms of power and conspiracy, making it a must-watch for any fans of gripping thrillers with a touch of espionage intrigue. The 6/10 is appropriate."
"The Beekeeper","DocteurDream","30 January 2024",NA,"Verona Parker is easily one of the worst characters ever written for the screen, takes away everything this movie aspires to be. The actress also did a piss poor job and always had me cringing at the unrealistic and unreasonable choices she makes. If you'd delete that character entirely, this movie would've been a whole lot better in the long run.Subject wise it's a very nice concept of a revenge thriller against scam call centers- but again, the whole govt mumbo jumbo makes it feel a whole run of the mill action BS from Hollywood mid tier movies. If the story had been awhole lot grounded, it would've done a whole lot better imo."
"The Beekeeper","kjproulx","12 January 2024",NA,"By now, audiences should realize what they are in for when it comes to Jason Statham leading an action film. The Beekeeper is the latest film to continue his long-running legacy of action flicks and it's quite a bit of fun. It's very far from an awards nominee, but for a film I had zero expectations for, and for being as cheesy as it is, it's pretty good. Take that as you will because I will be diving into things that are also pretty bad as well. The cheesiness of this film will turn some people off, but I was able to ignore it. Here's why I recommend The Beekeeper if you want to watch a new action-packed film to enjoy and not have to think too much about.The ""Beekeepers"" is an organization of hitmen who take out criminals. Jason Statham plays Adam Clay, a retiree from this organization, who is on a manhunt for everyone involved in scamming a woman he cared for, which led to her suicide. It's as simple as that. There are multiple bosses in this company, so it's like watching a sophisticated video game being played out. The action sequences are well-choreographed and there are quite a few action scenes, so overall, this film was a blast to watch. With that said, the dialogue from beginning to end it pretty atrocious.If the script had been reworked, I think this could've been a surprisingly great film as a whole. Sadly, the dialogue is full of Bee puns that fall flat almost every time, even with solid actors delivering them. The character arc and dialogue for Josh Hutcherson's Derek Danforth (who is the main villain of the film) is laughable, and not really in a good way. His whiny, self-entitled performance was great and I liked that he was giving this character his all, it's just that, again, the dialogue sucks. The lines everyone was saying took me out of the experience many times. Still, there is a lot of great action, and that's what I wanted from a movie like this anyway. I'm sure the dialogue will have people hating this movie and I'm equally sure certain people will find it hilarious. I'm kind of in the middle.The Beekeeper is David Ayer's latest directorial effort and as always, he does a great job with action. His touch as a director is always welcomed by me and the neon look to the film was cool as well. It's a cool film to watch and it's aesthetically pleasing. I may be ripping apart the script, but it's just the dialogue. The story itself plays out nicely and has a nice resolution. I was looking for a fun action film and this film delivered that, despite its downfalls. I say check it out."
"The Beekeeper","FeastMode","12 January 2024",NA,"I seem to use that headline a lot. I guess it's better than a bad movie with bad fight scenes.Starting with the good, Statham is awesome as usual. And I loved all of the fight scenes. They are ridiculously fast yet completely clear. It's hard hitting, you can feel the blows. This is enhanced by the beastly IMAX speakers. And with the R-rating, it doesn't hold back. Although it's far from gratuitous.The bad? Sigh. The non-action scenes, which make up the majority of the movie, range from average to terrible. The quality level feels like a streaming movie, not a theatrical one. I spent much of the runtime uninterested and unengaged.Everything feels off. The dialogue is weird. The acting is questionable. And there are a bunch of dumb things that strain believability. Like the entire bad guy organization. Or a laugh-out-loud idiotic character decision during the climax. A true ""are you kidding me?"" moment.Even the cut to credits felt odd. Like the director just cut in the middle of a shot and said, ""screw it, let's go home.""(1 viewing, early screening UltraScreen 1/6/2024)"
"The Beekeeper","Neptune165","2 February 2024",NA,"Just when you think we have reached the bottom of filmmaking ... there is always something like this flick just to prove you can do a lot worse! It s so bland. The FBI agent was not professional and dressed and sounded dumb, lost mom by suicidal act and that did not play much of a roll after the incident,, the villains sounded stupid, especially the dip shots from the call centers. The story idea was great, Jason was awesome but the rest of the actors failed to bring it home. This movie is a terrible revenge story. The idea that Beekeepers are the most elite, well-trained, best equipped one man army is so over-used. The most unbelievable part is that he is hunted by mercenaries, law enforcement, and other Beekeepers. The acting is terrible, the storyline is worse."
"The Beekeeper","BA_Harrison","12 January 2024",NA,"After Fast X and The Meg 2, I swore I wouldn't waste any more of my time on Jason Statham movies, but the trailer for The Beekeeper looked good, so I thought I would give him one last chance. I just hoped that I wouldn't get stung again.Thankfully, this action flick from director David Ayer is as sweet as honey: it's unpretentious, over-the-top, gloriously violent nonsense that isn't to be taken seriously... the film is all about how many people the star can kill or maim during the 1hr 45minute runtime (the answer: a lot!).Statham plays Adam Clay, a beekeeper in more ways than one: he looks after bee hives on the farm owned by kindly Eloise Parker (Phylicia Rashad), but he's also a retired special operative known as a 'beekeeper', part of a government programme so secret even the FBI doesn't know about it. When Eloise loses all of her savings to scammers and commits suicide, Adam isn't a happy man and goes after those responsible, the trail leading all the way to the President of the United States (Jemma Redgrave).Buildings are blown up, limbs are broken, body parts are severed, people are shot, but Adam barely gets a scratch -- those looking for realism should look elsewhere. There's even a scene where a female beekeeper uses a mini-gun mounted on the back of a truck, and mini-guns always equal fun.At the end of the day, Adam makes the bad guys pay for their crimes, and promptly escapes, presumably to set up some more bee hives (the villains having shot up his earlier ones) and to prepare for the inevitable sequel."
"The Beekeeper","imseeg","12 January 2024",NA,"I was excited to see a new action movie with Jason Statham (one of my favorite ACTION actors) and although his figting scenes are still okay (ish), they weren't exhilirating. But there is something worse...The bad: Jason Statham (although in a leading role) doesnt get much screen time. A lot of the time we ONLY get to see a bunch of bland FBI agents, who arent impressing me in any way with their subpar acting performances.Nor do these FBI agents come across as credible by the way, constantly missing Jason Statham when they have all the time and opportunity to kill him point blank. Quite silly.More bad: the other supporting actors are really bad though, But they (AS WELL) do get a lot of screentime. So annoying.Not any good? Actor Jeremy Irons nails it. He plays the role of a cunning sophisticated bad guy and he is terrific. But what the heck is the distinguished and superb actor Jeremy Irons doing in such a cheap looking action movie? HE is the only redeeming feature of this movie though, besides a few action scenes with Jason Statham.Jason Statham fans beware, this one is quite a dud. Tedious, lame, uneventful."
"The Beekeeper","Xavier_Stone","10 January 2024",NA,"Written by Kurt Wimmer who is known for The Expendables which seems about right. Nearly all action which was ok, yet the story is just trash. If you're a fan of Jason then this one is just another average film with his stunts and fighting.Other than that the movie lacks any seriousness and the law enforcement roles are comical and everyone just comes out looking like keystone cops. It could have been so much better with a decent director and a lot of tweaks in the script.Sadly, not enough going on here to please anything but the Jason fans. 3 stars for action, zero for everything else. Even the ending is a zero. Park your brain before watching, no thinking required."
"The Beekeeper","martinrobertson300482","28 January 2024",NA,"Not sure why i went to see this one as i've not seen most of Jason Stathams movies. And if they're anything like this one i won't be in a rush to revisit them.The movie looked dumb, and it is. Statham is a beekeeper. Both metaphorically and genuinely. Infact the worst part of the film isn't how repetitive and boring the action gets (where Statham is practically untouchable). But the cringey push to make ex-military beekeeper tough guys a thing. You'll definitely get some laughs from how ridiculous it all is. But half the time I couldn't really tell if they were intentional laughs or not.I guess there is enough decent action. Like the farm scene, the middle office attack, and there's a decent brutal fight scene near the end. But even the most promising part of the movie - setting up the great villian for a well deserved ass kicking later. Doesn't pay off. So overall, pretty poor."
"The Beekeeper","banzoozalreviews","12 January 2024",NA,"David Ayer's ""The Beekeeper"" has Jason Statham going full John Wick and full Equalizer. This movie is 90 odd minutes of relentless, unhinged, pure escapist fun, with Statham doing what he does best - taking out bad guys like it's nothing and looking uber cool while doing it. He does that here in spades, in the most brutal and ridiculously entertaining ways. Yes, you need to throw believability aside, but if you are a fan of 80s and 90s action thrillers where it's one man against all, you will love this, just like I did. This movie really was a blast and a half, and then some. A great way to start 2024 movie season. I loved it. Pure escapist entertainment."
"The Beekeeper","kuner-59029","14 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper attempts to copy the John Wick formula to the point of plagiarism.The setup is virtually the same. Statham, playing himself as usual, is retired and extremely dangerous ex-assassin, member of a secret group called ""Beekeepers"". He get pulled out of retirement over a seemingly minor incident, and the conflict escalates.A woman he sells honey to (played by the mom from the Cosby Show) commits suicide after having her savings stolen by a scammer company.He takes revenge for her, but oh no, the company belongs to the president's no-good son (similar to the Russian Mob boss's son in the John Wick original).He fights his way to the top through many neon-lit setpieces until he reaches the final boss. The end.However, unlike John Wick, there is none of the fascinating world building, none of the flair, none of the great music editing, much of the acting is awful, and so the whole thing comes apart at the seams. Tonally, the film never hits the mark. Scenes variate between overacted and ridiculous to boring, slow paced and TV series like. Every time the narrative switches to a female FBI agent, the air is sucked out of the movie, and energy comes to a grinding halt.The use of music is awful. It alternates between Batman knock off cello and contrabass strings, which don't fit at all, to house and electronic in scenes where it doesn't fit either. It worked in John Wick, because it was woven into the story. John Wick was either in a night club, or the music was played on the Assassin's radio station. Here it just comes out of nowhere.There are a few good kills. The car off the drawbridge early on is excellent. The final boss fight was decent, but not over the top enough to be memorable.Overall, this is a poorly made film that you will forget the moment you finish it. It's barely watchable, but I deducted points for plagiarism."
"The Beekeeper","sbweightman","12 January 2024",NA,"A really enjoyable revenge action film full of fast paced action and corny bee-related dialogue. Although the character's backstory has been done many times before, the plot has some modern ideas and modern villains which are easy to hate and the strong moral message was quite refreshing. Good acting from a good cast of characters and whilst some of the henchmen are a bit silly, their larger than life presence adds some surprises into what is otherwise pretty standard fare. Good pacing, music and fight scenes keep it entertaining throughout, although the start is pretty slow and the ending rather abrupt."
"The Beekeeper","olcare","10 January 2024",NA,"I mean, I don't know what to say; it feels like the movie's script was randomly written without any thought. The events are so poorly explained that I couldn't believe it while watching. I have no idea how they shot it. I'm addressing everyone who watched and gave good ratings: watch it again, life is not that simple.I want to mention Jason Statham. The only good thing in the movie is Jason. He is more than an actor; he's an excellent athlete, continuing this for years and elevating all the action scenes in every action movie. In some fight scenes in this film, extras stand there taking hits flatly, and it's entirely the fault of those who planned the scenes.There's no recognizable plot; the character just walks straight into the president of some made-up country's house, kills 30 people, and we watch this for 1 hour and 40 minutes. The FBI is portrayed as if it's a village organization; the detectives hang out like it's their dad's farm. It's unbelievable. They wrote a movie without sitting down and thinking about these details; it's astonishing.The Beekeeper program is constantly mentioned in the film, but what is it? What do these people do? How were they trained? What hardships did they endure? None of it is there; they just expect us to believe in a name. There's nothing about how the top-secret deadly agents of the government are trained.Money theft and the presidential race are portrayed like child's play. These are not people you can easily reach; to blow up a building or enter the president's mansion, you need an incredibly good script, and this film has none of that.The acting is also bad, except for Jason Statham. There's no good performance except him. The character's motivation is bad too; killing 100 people because a woman who treated him well while beekeeping shot herself. We should have seen a 3-5 minute segment about their intimacy.I don't know what else to say; it just goes on and on, complete bulls**t. I'm thinking about David Ayer's early works, and nowadays, each film he makes is dragging everything further down. The screenwriter, Kurt Wimmer, has also messed up; he wrote it thoughtlessly. I'm eagerly anticipating the film's complete failure at the box office. Definitely a waste of time.."

That movie had a script and good acting. But this... What is this? Is it made for teenage boys? For adults? For girls? Boys? I don't know, but the result is nothing new, nothing thrilling and nothing fun.So what do we got. Well, that's a really good question. The problem is that there's very, very hard to find a good answer."
"The Beekeeper","Brillfury","13 January 2024",NA,"Look,I love a good action flick as much as anyone, and Jason Statham is usually awesome. But sadly director David Ayer delivers what will probably be one of the worst movies of 2024. Ayer made one great movie over 20 years ago (Training Day) and also delivered a good flick in Fury, but everything else he makes is horrible. I will admit I did get a kick out of how dumb and goofy this movie is, and laughed a lot. Statham's character is like a cardboard box, it's so boring. Yes his fighting scenes are very cool but he's played awesome characters before that also had a bit of kick. In this movie he gives us nothing.Phylicia Rashad looks fabulous and gets about 5 minutes of screen time. Jeremy Irons and Josh Hutcherson do a great job but their talents are wasted in this movie.The plot starts out really promising...who wouldn't love to see a revenge action movie where the evil call centers get justice? But sadly the premise is wasted.Oh if you love hearing the word ""Beekeeper"" and references to bees you'll love this.The dialogue in this movie is so corny. It's almost like a satire of action movies at some points.In David Ayer's world, nothing works like it actually does in the real world. It is so goofy the way he portrays everything. And this is something he does in a lot of his movies. Just dumb fictional versions of everything from presidents to agencies to how classified programs work. But I do understand they have to make movies and sometimes make everything really stupid to be entertaining. But this movie takes the cake. For instance, call center scams are a real thing and there are many YouTube videos showing how they operate. But in this movie, the call center office is the most over the top clown spectacle you'll ever see and the actual scam is a ludicrous fictionalized version of how they actually work.The two main FBI agents are portrayed goofy AF and their dialogue is nearly unbearable.Statham's character, the beekeeper, doesn't want you to steal from old people but he has no qualms with murdering about 50 federal law enforcement officers in the course of the movie without batting an eye.So if you are about 13 years old this movie will be the coolest thing you've seen but anywhere over that and it's just too dumb. Maybe when it's on streaming it might be fun to watch and make fun of on a rainy day."

The plot is ridiculous, and the acting skills were as bad as a high school drama club,. At times, I felt like I was watching ann episode of NOVA learning all sorts of things about bees.

"The Beekeeper","samyakrout-65994","24 January 2024",NA,"The only good part the stealth and fitness of Jason Statham.This movie is so bad that where to start. Ofcourse the story didn't delayed and started immediately with a scam and then Jason went on killing spree.The first few actions were a bit relatable and ok but then the story became from good to bad and then worse when the president of USA showed up and the secret service could not even did the job they always were regarded as highly and that js to secure and save the president. No character building and not much of investigation.Its a one man show and the most irritating were those two FBI agents who for no reason were cracking boring jokes on each other and eve though they had chances but never cared to shoot him.The main villain who is again another immature gen z character who js always high on drugs was easily having drugs within the presidential house and killed the fbi director as if nothing to worry about.Damn boring boring and repetitive. All characters were so boring and irritable in nature.The best scene was the ending when i left my seat."
"The Beekeeper","chenp-54708","12 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper is one of those dumb stupid action movies that are so ridiculously dumb, yet still has some strong parts. Director David Ayer isn't a filmmaker I really like but I have enjoyed a few of his works like Training Day and End of Watch. His previous movie The Tax Collector was absolutely atrocious but The Beekeeper is slightly better than his last movie.Many of the action thrills, stunts, moments and scenes were ridiculous but for the most part, well-executed and shot pretty well. Although with some mix of poor editing and bad uses of CGI. All the performances were okay as Jason Statham still plays himself but still the fun aspect of the movie. The narrative is pretty ridiculous and kind of dumb where the more you think about it, the more dumber it becomes. The style definitely takes a bit too much influence on the John Wick series and some of the dialogue is quite laughable. But hey, all in all, I did enjoy some moments because it clearly doesn't take itself too seriously and the actions, thrills and Statham being himself was pretty fun."
"The Beekeeper","kmkevinn-64733","12 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper buzzes with intensity as it unveils a gripping tale of vengeance that transcends personal vendettas to impact an entire nation. The film takes you on a relentless journey with one man, a former operative of the enigmatic 'Beekeepers.' What begins as a brutal campaign for personal justice quickly escalates into a high-stakes thriller with national consequences. The storytelling is a masterclass maybe mediocre in suspense, weaving a web of intrigue and unveiling layers of a clandestine organization. The protagonist's journey from a solitary avenger to a player in a larger, more dangerous game is both compelling, almost average and chilling. The Beekeeper delivers not only on the promise of riveting action but also explores the shadowy realms of power and conspiracy, making it a must-watch for any fans of gripping thrillers with a touch of espionage intrigue. The 6/10 is appropriate."
"The Beekeeper","DocteurDream","30 January 2024",NA,"Verona Parker is easily one of the worst characters ever written for the screen, takes away everything this movie aspires to be. The actress also did a piss poor job and always had me cringing at the unrealistic and unreasonable choices she makes. If you'd delete that character entirely, this movie would've been a whole lot better in the long run.Subject wise it's a very nice concept of a revenge thriller against scam call centers- but again, the whole govt mumbo jumbo makes it feel a whole run of the mill action BS from Hollywood mid tier movies. If the story had been awhole lot grounded, it would've done a whole lot better imo."
"The Beekeeper","kjproulx","12 January 2024",NA,"By now, audiences should realize what they are in for when it comes to Jason Statham leading an action film. The Beekeeper is the latest film to continue his long-running legacy of action flicks and it's quite a bit of fun. It's very far from an awards nominee, but for a film I had zero expectations for, and for being as cheesy as it is, it's pretty good. Take that as you will because I will be diving into things that are also pretty bad as well. The cheesiness of this film will turn some people off, but I was able to ignore it. Here's why I recommend The Beekeeper if you want to watch a new action-packed film to enjoy and not have to think too much about.The ""Beekeepers"" is an organization of hitmen who take out criminals. Jason Statham plays Adam Clay, a retiree from this organization, who is on a manhunt for everyone involved in scamming a woman he cared for, which led to her suicide. It's as simple as that. There are multiple bosses in this company, so it's like watching a sophisticated video game being played out. The action sequences are well-choreographed and there are quite a few action scenes, so overall, this film was a blast to watch. With that said, the dialogue from beginning to end it pretty atrocious.If the script had been reworked, I think this could've been a surprisingly great film as a whole. Sadly, the dialogue is full of Bee puns that fall flat almost every time, even with solid actors delivering them. The character arc and dialogue for Josh Hutcherson's Derek Danforth (who is the main villain of the film) is laughable, and not really in a good way. His whiny, self-entitled performance was great and I liked that he was giving this character his all, it's just that, again, the dialogue sucks. The lines everyone was saying took me out of the experience many times. Still, there is a lot of great action, and that's what I wanted from a movie like this anyway. I'm sure the dialogue will have people hating this movie and I'm equally sure certain people will find it hilarious. I'm kind of in the middle.The Beekeeper is David Ayer's latest directorial effort and as always, he does a great job with action. His touch as a director is always welcomed by me and the neon look to the film was cool as well. It's a cool film to watch and it's aesthetically pleasing. I may be ripping apart the script, but it's just the dialogue. The story itself plays out nicely and has a nice resolution. I was looking for a fun action film and this film delivered that, despite its downfalls. I say check it out."
"The Beekeeper","FeastMode","12 January 2024",NA,"I seem to use that headline a lot. I guess it's better than a bad movie with bad fight scenes.Starting with the good, Statham is awesome as usual. And I loved all of the fight scenes. They are ridiculously fast yet completely clear. It's hard hitting, you can feel the blows. This is enhanced by the beastly IMAX speakers. And with the R-rating, it doesn't hold back. Although it's far from gratuitous.The bad? Sigh. The non-action scenes, which make up the majority of the movie, range from average to terrible. The quality level feels like a streaming movie, not a theatrical one. I spent much of the runtime uninterested and unengaged.Everything feels off. The dialogue is weird. The acting is questionable. And there are a bunch of dumb things that strain believability. Like the entire bad guy organization. Or a laugh-out-loud idiotic character decision during the climax. A true ""are you kidding me?"" moment.Even the cut to credits felt odd. Like the director just cut in the middle of a shot and said, ""screw it, let's go home.""(1 viewing, early screening UltraScreen 1/6/2024)"
"The Beekeeper","Neptune165","2 February 2024",NA,"Just when you think we have reached the bottom of filmmaking ... there is always something like this flick just to prove you can do a lot worse! It s so bland. The FBI agent was not professional and dressed and sounded dumb, lost mom by suicidal act and that did not play much of a roll after the incident,, the villains sounded stupid, especially the dip shots from the call centers. The story idea was great, Jason was awesome but the rest of the actors failed to bring it home. This movie is a terrible revenge story. The idea that Beekeepers are the most elite, well-trained, best equipped one man army is so over-used. The most unbelievable part is that he is hunted by mercenaries, law enforcement, and other Beekeepers. The acting is terrible, the storyline is worse."
"The Beekeeper","BA_Harrison","12 January 2024",NA,"After Fast X and The Meg 2, I swore I wouldn't waste any more of my time on Jason Statham movies, but the trailer for The Beekeeper looked good, so I thought I would give him one last chance. I just hoped that I wouldn't get stung again.Thankfully, this action flick from director David Ayer is as sweet as honey: it's unpretentious, over-the-top, gloriously violent nonsense that isn't to be taken seriously... the film is all about how many people the star can kill or maim during the 1hr 45minute runtime (the answer: a lot!).Statham plays Adam Clay, a beekeeper in more ways than one: he looks after bee hives on the farm owned by kindly Eloise Parker (Phylicia Rashad), but he's also a retired special operative known as a 'beekeeper', part of a government programme so secret even the FBI doesn't know about it. When Eloise loses all of her savings to scammers and commits suicide, Adam isn't a happy man and goes after those responsible, the trail leading all the way to the President of the United States (Jemma Redgrave).Buildings are blown up, limbs are broken, body parts are severed, people are shot, but Adam barely gets a scratch -- those looking for realism should look elsewhere. There's even a scene where a female beekeeper uses a mini-gun mounted on the back of a truck, and mini-guns always equal fun.At the end of the day, Adam makes the bad guys pay for their crimes, and promptly escapes, presumably to set up some more bee hives (the villains having shot up his earlier ones) and to prepare for the inevitable sequel."
"The Beekeeper","imseeg","12 January 2024",NA,"I was excited to see a new action movie with Jason Statham (one of my favorite ACTION actors) and although his figting scenes are still okay (ish), they weren't exhilirating. But there is something worse...The bad: Jason Statham (although in a leading role) doesnt get much screen time. A lot of the time we ONLY get to see a bunch of bland FBI agents, who arent impressing me in any way with their subpar acting performances.Nor do these FBI agents come across as credible by the way, constantly missing Jason Statham when they have all the time and opportunity to kill him point blank. Quite silly.More bad: the other supporting actors are really bad though, But they (AS WELL) do get a lot of screentime. So annoying.Not any good? Actor Jeremy Irons nails it. He plays the role of a cunning sophisticated bad guy and he is terrific. But what the heck is the distinguished and superb actor Jeremy Irons doing in such a cheap looking action movie? HE is the only redeeming feature of this movie though, besides a few action scenes with Jason Statham.Jason Statham fans beware, this one is quite a dud. Tedious, lame, uneventful."
"The Beekeeper","Xavier_Stone","10 January 2024",NA,"Written by Kurt Wimmer who is known for The Expendables which seems about right. Nearly all action which was ok, yet the story is just trash. If you're a fan of Jason then this one is just another average film with his stunts and fighting.Other than that the movie lacks any seriousness and the law enforcement roles are comical and everyone just comes out looking like keystone cops. It could have been so much better with a decent director and a lot of tweaks in the script.Sadly, not enough going on here to please anything but the Jason fans. 3 stars for action, zero for everything else. Even the ending is a zero. Park your brain before watching, no thinking required."
"The Beekeeper","martinrobertson300482","28 January 2024",NA,"Not sure why i went to see this one as i've not seen most of Jason Stathams movies. And if they're anything like this one i won't be in a rush to revisit them.The movie looked dumb, and it is. Statham is a beekeeper. Both metaphorically and genuinely. Infact the worst part of the film isn't how repetitive and boring the action gets (where Statham is practically untouchable). But the cringey push to make ex-military beekeeper tough guys a thing. You'll definitely get some laughs from how ridiculous it all is. But half the time I couldn't really tell if they were intentional laughs or not.I guess there is enough decent action. Like the farm scene, the middle office attack, and there's a decent brutal fight scene near the end. But even the most promising part of the movie - setting up the great villian for a well deserved ass kicking later. Doesn't pay off. So overall, pretty poor."
"The Beekeeper","banzoozalreviews","12 January 2024",NA,"David Ayer's ""The Beekeeper"" has Jason Statham going full John Wick and full Equalizer. This movie is 90 odd minutes of relentless, unhinged, pure escapist fun, with Statham doing what he does best - taking out bad guys like it's nothing and looking uber cool while doing it. He does that here in spades, in the most brutal and ridiculously entertaining ways. Yes, you need to throw believability aside, but if you are a fan of 80s and 90s action thrillers where it's one man against all, you will love this, just like I did. This movie really was a blast and a half, and then some. A great way to start 2024 movie season. I loved it. Pure escapist entertainment."
"The Beekeeper","kuner-59029","14 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper attempts to copy the John Wick formula to the point of plagiarism.The setup is virtually the same. Statham, playing himself as usual, is retired and extremely dangerous ex-assassin, member of a secret group called ""Beekeepers"". He get pulled out of retirement over a seemingly minor incident, and the conflict escalates.A woman he sells honey to (played by the mom from the Cosby Show) commits suicide after having her savings stolen by a scammer company.He takes revenge for her, but oh no, the company belongs to the president's no-good son (similar to the Russian Mob boss's son in the John Wick original).He fights his way to the top through many neon-lit setpieces until he reaches the final boss. The end.However, unlike John Wick, there is none of the fascinating world building, none of the flair, none of the great music editing, much of the acting is awful, and so the whole thing comes apart at the seams. Tonally, the film never hits the mark. Scenes variate between overacted and ridiculous to boring, slow paced and TV series like. Every time the narrative switches to a female FBI agent, the air is sucked out of the movie, and energy comes to a grinding halt.The use of music is awful. It alternates between Batman knock off cello and contrabass strings, which don't fit at all, to house and electronic in scenes where it doesn't fit either. It worked in John Wick, because it was woven into the story. John Wick was either in a night club, or the music was played on the Assassin's radio station. Here it just comes out of nowhere.There are a few good kills. The car off the drawbridge early on is excellent. The final boss fight was decent, but not over the top enough to be memorable.Overall, this is a poorly made film that you will forget the moment you finish it. It's barely watchable, but I deducted points for plagiarism."
"The Beekeeper","sbweightman","12 January 2024",NA,"A really enjoyable revenge action film full of fast paced action and corny bee-related dialogue. Although the character's backstory has been done many times before, the plot has some modern ideas and modern villains which are easy to hate and the strong moral message was quite refreshing. Good acting from a good cast of characters and whilst some of the henchmen are a bit silly, their larger than life presence adds some surprises into what is otherwise pretty standard fare. Good pacing, music and fight scenes keep it entertaining throughout, although the start is pretty slow and the ending rather abrupt."
"The Beekeeper","olcare","10 January 2024",NA,"I mean, I don't know what to say; it feels like the movie's script was randomly written without any thought. The events are so poorly explained that I couldn't believe it while watching. I have no idea how they shot it. I'm addressing everyone who watched and gave good ratings: watch it again, life is not that simple.I want to mention Jason Statham. The only good thing in the movie is Jason. He is more than an actor; he's an excellent athlete, continuing this for years and elevating all the action scenes in every action movie. In some fight scenes in this film, extras stand there taking hits flatly, and it's entirely the fault of those who planned the scenes.There's no recognizable plot; the character just walks straight into the president of some made-up country's house, kills 30 people, and we watch this for 1 hour and 40 minutes. The FBI is portrayed as if it's a village organization; the detectives hang out like it's their dad's farm. It's unbelievable. They wrote a movie without sitting down and thinking about these details; it's astonishing.The Beekeeper program is constantly mentioned in the film, but what is it? What do these people do? How were they trained? What hardships did they endure? None of it is there; they just expect us to believe in a name. There's nothing about how the top-secret deadly agents of the government are trained.Money theft and the presidential race are portrayed like child's play. These are not people you can easily reach; to blow up a building or enter the president's mansion, you need an incredibly good script, and this film has none of that.The acting is also bad, except for Jason Statham. There's no good performance except him. The character's motivation is bad too; killing 100 people because a woman who treated him well while beekeeping shot herself. We should have seen a 3-5 minute segment about their intimacy.I don't know what else to say; it just goes on and on, complete bulls**t. I'm thinking about David Ayer's early works, and nowadays, each film he makes is dragging everything further down. The screenwriter, Kurt Wimmer, has also messed up; he wrote it thoughtlessly. I'm eagerly anticipating the film's complete failure at the box office. Definitely a waste of time.."
"The Beekeeper","UniqueParticle","11 January 2024",NA,"So glad I got to see an early screening in imax on 1-6-24 just couldn't review yet. Anyway such an enriching thrill ride to satisfy any action fan of badass one man army types kinda like John Wick with a different style to it! I've been a fan of Jason Statham for a couple decades now and this is one of his best. The writing is magnificent too Kurt Whimmer is perfect for in depth action extravaganza.For an autistic person that's been scammed numerous times Beekeeper hit the spot; I absolutely loved the way everything played out. Well directed, crystal smooth writing, amazing story and top notch action; highly recommend I'll definitely want to own in 4K!"
"The Beekeeper","dam-24421","31 January 2024",NA,"They forgot to write a script? Or bring their head along in this movie?Nothing seemed to work, acting, storyline, everything was so rushed. The actors were incredibly bad, especially Parker. That must be some of the most cringe, b acting I have ever seen. It was unwatchable, I stayed in the cinema because I had my little brother with me, and wouldn't be rude and interfere with the other people in the cinema.This movies gets -3/10Way too cheesy and cringe. David Ayer this is a redo, better luck next time. My sincere condolences for the people watching.Just another movie for the money, so sad."
"The Beekeeper","petercarlsson-92297","30 January 2024",NA,"Jason Statham does the same movie - again - that he's been doing the last 20 years. This time without a script. They just stacked a number of fight and action scenes on top of each other, then called it a movie.Statham has done a few rather good movies like this. For example ""Homefront"". That movie had a script and good acting. But this... What is this? Is it made for teenage boys? For adults? For girls? Boys? I don't know, but the result is nothing new, nothing thrilling and nothing fun.So what do we got. Well, that's a really good question. The problem is that there's very, very hard to find a good answer."
"The Beekeeper","Brillfury","13 January 2024",NA,"Look,I love a good action flick as much as anyone, and Jason Statham is usually awesome. But sadly director David Ayer delivers what will probably be one of the worst movies of 2024. Ayer made one great movie over 20 years ago (Training Day) and also delivered a good flick in Fury, but everything else he makes is horrible. I will admit I did get a kick out of how dumb and goofy this movie is, and laughed a lot. Statham's character is like a cardboard box, it's so boring. Yes his fighting scenes are very cool but he's played awesome characters before that also had a bit of kick. In this movie he gives us nothing.Phylicia Rashad looks fabulous and gets about 5 minutes of screen time. Jeremy Irons and Josh Hutcherson do a great job but their talents are wasted in this movie.The plot starts out really promising...who wouldn't love to see a revenge action movie where the evil call centers get justice? But sadly the premise is wasted.Oh if you love hearing the word ""Beekeeper"" and references to bees you'll love this.The dialogue in this movie is so corny. It's almost like a satire of action movies at some points.In David Ayer's world, nothing works like it actually does in the real world. It is so goofy the way he portrays everything. And this is something he does in a lot of his movies. Just dumb fictional versions of everything from presidents to agencies to how classified programs work. But I do understand they have to make movies and sometimes make everything really stupid to be entertaining. But this movie takes the cake. For instance, call center scams are a real thing and there are many YouTube videos showing how they operate. But in this movie, the call center office is the most over the top clown spectacle you'll ever see and the actual scam is a ludicrous fictionalized version of how they actually work.The two main FBI agents are portrayed goofy AF and their dialogue is nearly unbearable.Statham's character, the beekeeper, doesn't want you to steal from old people but he has no qualms with murdering about 50 federal law enforcement officers in the course of the movie without batting an eye.So if you are about 13 years old this movie will be the coolest thing you've seen but anywhere over that and it's just too dumb. Maybe when it's on streaming it might be fun to watch and make fun of on a rainy day."
"The Beekeeper","TheNamelessCzar","27 January 2024",NA,"This may be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in the theater. I should've known better knowing I was going to see a Jason Statham movie. He has no talent, and he simply is known for his name and his action/fighting skills. But the reviews were so good! Apparently, the reviewers were paid off. The plot is ridiculous, and the acting skills were as bad as a high school drama club,. At times, I felt like I was watching ann episode of NOVA learning all sorts of things about bees. Statham has one facial expression in the movie, and it looks like boredom. Never again will I see on of his movie sin the theater... I'll wait to bore myself at home when it comes on streaming instead."
"The Beekeeper","masonsaul","13 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper isn't as tight or condensed as the films it borrows from thanks to an unexpectedly dense mythology but it really delivers where it counts. It's essentially Jason Statham beating people up for 100 minutes and it never gets old. Thankfully it doesn't really sequel bait however more of these would definitely be welcome.Jason Statham is never bad even when he's in a dud like a few of his recent films. Even so, it's nice to see his talent and physicality employed in something actually good. Jeremy Irons has the ability to deliver exposition about beekeeping in an engaging manner and Josh Hutcherson is actually awake for this one.Similarly to Statham, David Ayer has had a few misses so it's equally rewarding to see him back doing what he knows best whilst showing he and his team are really good at hand to hand combat. The score by David Sardy & Jared Michael Fry is a huge part of why this works, treating the dumbest twists with the utmost seriousness."
"The Beekeeper","masonfisk","30 January 2024",NA,"The first film of the year may rank as one of the worst for the same as Jason Statham kicks butts & takes names (or is it the other way around?) in this goofy revenge tale. Statham, a former government operative, has retired plying his trade running an apiary on a retired woman's property, Phylicia Rashad, but after she commits suicide after being ripped off by some internet sharks prompting Statham to spew bad bee puns while he kills his way to the top (or bottom, these people are scum!) in a concern which runs right to the heights of the White House as the president's, Gemma Redgrave, (from Howard's End) son, played by Josh Hutcherson, is raking in millions from duped customers which will not stand as far as Statham is concerned. David Ayer, a mismatched director for this material (was Shane Black busy?), directs a particularly goofy premise from scenarist David Wimmer, does not help a whit w/humorless Statham doing the physical lifting w/o any issues but the unintentional guffaws generated from villains who look like extras from The Terminator's Tech-noir dance club scene makes this memorable outing for the wrong reasons. Also starring Oscar winner Jeremy Irons as Redgrave's handler, Oscar nominee Minnie Driver (wasted frankly!) as a government contact & Emmy Raver-Lampman (from The Umbrella Academy) who plays Rashad's daughter."
"The Beekeeper","timeblank","21 January 2024",NA,"I fell victim to a scam, and it's satisfying to see scammers getting their due in the Beekeeper movie. Jason Statham's action-packed destruction of the building and culprits is glorious. Despite the absurd plot, the theme of justice prevails. The constant investigation of Statham's crimes is annoying, and the movie's direction raises many questions. The initial 30 minutes were captivating, but the eventual disappointment left me perplexed. Nonetheless, I still enjoyed the movie, even with its absurdities.Beekeeper seems like a John Wick movie - I acknowledge the similarities, but it's purely for entertainment, nothing beyond that!"
"The Beekeeper","slydon13","21 January 2024",NA,"When you see the opening credits - Minnie Driver, Jeremy Irons and Phylicia Rashad - the possiblity exists that this could be worth watching. Ms Driver only had the 2 scenes so she didn't have to be paid as much to surrender her dignity to keep a straight face . Jeremy Irons had to work much harder.The target audience is presumably teenage boys who don't expect or need a script. I presume the 3 actors named above where offered ridiculous money to be part of this enterprise. They are the comprobable film to the Hallmark Christmas movie (with everything pretty much similar to the cookie cutter used for all the previous examples )Presumably they had X number of required explosions , Y in the stunt crew, calculated Z as the number of scenes with a few gaps for words (lets not call it a script)The industry needs these kind of 'Expendeble' wholy forgettable flic to fill in.I only went to see this because I had a free ticket and if I had actually PAID money to see this, I'd likely be angry at my choice or disappointed.There are lots of better old films from the 30s, 40s, 50 etc .

The actress also did a piss poor job and always had me cringing at the unrealistic and unreasonable choices she makes. If you'd delete that character entirely, this movie would've been a whole lot better in the long run.Subject wise it's a very nice concept of a revenge thriller against scam call centers- but again, the whole govt mumbo jumbo makes it feel a whole run of the mill action BS from Hollywood mid tier movies. If the story had been awhole lot grounded, it would've done a whole lot better imo."
"The Beekeeper","kjproulx","12 January 2024",NA,"By now, audiences should realize what they are in for when it comes to Jason Statham leading an action film. The Beekeeper is the latest film to continue his long-running legacy of action flicks and it's quite a bit of fun. It's very far from an awards nominee, but for a film I had zero expectations for, and for being as cheesy as it is, it's pretty good. Take that as you will because I will be diving into things that are also pretty bad as well. The cheesiness of this film will turn some people off, but I was able to ignore it. Here's why I recommend The Beekeeper if you want to watch a new action-packed film to enjoy and not have to think too much about.The ""Beekeepers"" is an organization of hitmen who take out criminals. Jason Statham plays Adam Clay, a retiree from this organization, who is on a manhunt for everyone involved in scamming a woman he cared for, which led to her suicide. It's as simple as that. There are multiple bosses in this company, so it's like watching a sophisticated video game being played out. The action sequences are well-choreographed and there are quite a few action scenes, so overall, this film was a blast to watch. With that said, the dialogue from beginning to end it pretty atrocious.If the script had been reworked, I think this could've been a surprisingly great film as a whole. Sadly, the dialogue is full of Bee puns that fall flat almost every time, even with solid actors delivering them. The character arc and dialogue for Josh Hutcherson's Derek Danforth (who is the main villain of the film) is laughable, and not really in a good way. His whiny, self-entitled performance was great and I liked that he was giving this character his all, it's just that, again, the dialogue sucks. The lines everyone was saying took me out of the experience many times. Still, there is a lot of great action, and that's what I wanted from a movie like this anyway. I'm sure the dialogue will have people hating this movie and I'm equally sure certain people will find it hilarious. I'm kind of in the middle.The Beekeeper is David Ayer's latest directorial effort and as always, he does a great job with action. His touch as a director is always welcomed by me and the neon look to the film was cool as well. It's a cool film to watch and it's aesthetically pleasing. I may be ripping apart the script, but it's just the dialogue. The story itself plays out nicely and has a nice resolution. I was looking for a fun action film and this film delivered that, despite its downfalls. I say check it out."
"The Beekeeper","FeastMode","12 January 2024",NA,"I seem to use that headline a lot. I guess it's better than a bad movie with bad fight scenes.Starting with the good, Statham is awesome as usual. And I loved all of the fight scenes. They are ridiculously fast yet completely clear. It's hard hitting, you can feel the blows. This is enhanced by the beastly IMAX speakers. And with the R-rating, it doesn't hold back. Although it's far from gratuitous.The bad? Sigh. The non-action scenes, which make up the majority of the movie, range from average to terrible. The quality level feels like a streaming movie, not a theatrical one. I spent much of the runtime uninterested and unengaged.Everything feels off. The dialogue is weird. The acting is questionable. And there are a bunch of dumb things that strain believability. Like the entire bad guy organization. Or a laugh-out-loud idiotic character decision during the climax. A true ""are you kidding me?"" moment.Even the cut to credits felt odd. Like the director just cut in the middle of a shot and said, ""screw it, let's go home.""(1 viewing, early screening UltraScreen 1/6/2024)"
"The Beekeeper","Neptune165","2 February 2024",NA,"Just when you think we have reached the bottom of filmmaking ... there is always something like this flick just to prove you can do a lot worse! It s so bland. The FBI agent was not professional and dressed and sounded dumb, lost mom by suicidal act and that did not play much of a roll after the incident,, the villains sounded stupid, especially the dip shots from the call centers. The story idea was great, Jason was awesome but the rest of the actors failed to bring it home. This movie is a terrible revenge story. The idea that Beekeepers are the most elite, well-trained, best equipped one man army is so over-used. The most unbelievable part is that he is hunted by mercenaries, law enforcement, and other Beekeepers. The acting is terrible, the storyline is worse."
"The Beekeeper","BA_Harrison","12 January 2024",NA,"After Fast X and The Meg 2, I swore I wouldn't waste any more of my time on Jason Statham movies, but the trailer for The Beekeeper looked good, so I thought I would give him one last chance. I just hoped that I wouldn't get stung again.Thankfully, this action flick from director David Ayer is as sweet as honey: it's unpretentious, over-the-top, gloriously violent nonsense that isn't to be taken seriously... the film is all about how many people the star can kill or maim during the 1hr 45minute runtime (the answer: a lot!).Statham plays Adam Clay, a beekeeper in more ways than one: he looks after bee hives on the farm owned by kindly Eloise Parker (Phylicia Rashad), but he's also a retired special operative known as a 'beekeeper', part of a government programme so secret even the FBI doesn't know about it. When Eloise loses all of her savings to scammers and commits suicide, Adam isn't a happy man and goes after those responsible, the trail leading all the way to the President of the United States (Jemma Redgrave).Buildings are blown up, limbs are broken, body parts are severed, people are shot, but Adam barely gets a scratch -- those looking for realism should look elsewhere. There's even a scene where a female beekeeper uses a mini-gun mounted on the back of a truck, and mini-guns always equal fun.At the end of the day, Adam makes the bad guys pay for their crimes, and promptly escapes, presumably to set up some more bee hives (the villains having shot up his earlier ones) and to prepare for the inevitable sequel."
"The Beekeeper","imseeg","12 January 2024",NA,"I was excited to see a new action movie with Jason Statham (one of my favorite ACTION actors) and although his figting scenes are still okay (ish), they weren't exhilirating. But there is something worse...The bad: Jason Statham (although in a leading role) doesnt get much screen time. A lot of the time we ONLY get to see a bunch of bland FBI agents, who arent impressing me in any way with their subpar acting performances.Nor do these FBI agents come across as credible by the way, constantly missing Jason Statham when they have all the time and opportunity to kill him point blank. Quite silly.More bad: the other supporting actors are really bad though, But they (AS WELL) do get a lot of screentime. So annoying.Not any good? Actor Jeremy Irons nails it. He plays the role of a cunning sophisticated bad guy and he is terrific. But what the heck is the distinguished and superb actor Jeremy Irons doing in such a cheap looking action movie? HE is the only redeeming feature of this movie though, besides a few action scenes with Jason Statham.Jason Statham fans beware, this one is quite a dud. Tedious, lame, uneventful."
"The Beekeeper","Xavier_Stone","10 January 2024",NA,"Written by Kurt Wimmer who is known for The Expendables which seems about right. Nearly all action which was ok, yet the story is just trash. If you're a fan of Jason then this one is just another average film with his stunts and fighting.Other than that the movie lacks any seriousness and the law enforcement roles are comical and everyone just comes out looking like keystone cops. It could have been so much better with a decent director and a lot of tweaks in the script.Sadly, not enough going on here to please anything but the Jason fans. 3 stars for action, zero for everything else. Even the ending is a zero. Park your brain before watching, no thinking required."
"The Beekeeper","martinrobertson300482","28 January 2024",NA,"Not sure why i went to see this one as i've not seen most of Jason Stathams movies. And if they're anything like this one i won't be in a rush to revisit them.The movie looked dumb, and it is. Statham is a beekeeper. Both metaphorically and genuinely. Infact the worst part of the film isn't how repetitive and boring the action gets (where Statham is practically untouchable). But the cringey push to make ex-military beekeeper tough guys a thing. You'll definitely get some laughs from how ridiculous it all is. But half the time I couldn't really tell if they were intentional laughs or not.I guess there is enough decent action. Like the farm scene, the middle office attack, and there's a decent brutal fight scene near the end. But even the most promising part of the movie - setting up the great villian for a well deserved ass kicking later. Doesn't pay off. So overall, pretty poor."
"The Beekeeper","banzoozalreviews","12 January 2024",NA,"David Ayer's ""The Beekeeper"" has Jason Statham going full John Wick and full Equalizer. This movie is 90 odd minutes of relentless, unhinged, pure escapist fun, with Statham doing what he does best - taking out bad guys like it's nothing and looking uber cool while doing it. He does that here in spades, in the most brutal and ridiculously entertaining ways. Yes, you need to throw believability aside, but if you are a fan of 80s and 90s action thrillers where it's one man against all, you will love this, just like I did. This movie really was a blast and a half, and then some. A great way to start 2024 movie season. I loved it. Pure escapist entertainment."
"The Beekeeper","kuner-59029","14 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper attempts to copy the John Wick formula to the point of plagiarism.The setup is virtually the same. Statham, playing himself as usual, is retired and extremely dangerous ex-assassin, member of a secret group called ""Beekeepers"". He get pulled out of retirement over a seemingly minor incident, and the conflict escalates.A woman he sells honey to (played by the mom from the Cosby Show) commits suicide after having her savings stolen by a scammer company.He takes revenge for her, but oh no, the company belongs to the president's no-good son (similar to the Russian Mob boss's son in the John Wick original).He fights his way to the top through many neon-lit setpieces until he reaches the final boss. The end.However, unlike John Wick, there is none of the fascinating world building, none of the flair, none of the great music editing, much of the acting is awful, and so the whole thing comes apart at the seams. Tonally, the film never hits the mark. Scenes variate between overacted and ridiculous to boring, slow paced and TV series like. Every time the narrative switches to a female FBI agent, the air is sucked out of the movie, and energy comes to a grinding halt.The use of music is awful. It alternates between Batman knock off cello and contrabass strings, which don't fit at all, to house and electronic in scenes where it doesn't fit either. It worked in John Wick, because it was woven into the story. John Wick was either in a night club, or the music was played on the Assassin's radio station. Here it just comes out of nowhere.There are a few good kills. The car off the drawbridge early on is excellent. The final boss fight was decent, but not over the top enough to be memorable.Overall, this is a poorly made film that you will forget the moment you finish it. It's barely watchable, but I deducted points for plagiarism."
"The Beekeeper","sbweightman","12 January 2024",NA,"A really enjoyable revenge action film full of fast paced action and corny bee-related dialogue. Although the character's backstory has been done many times before, the plot has some modern ideas and modern villains which are easy to hate and the strong moral message was quite refreshing. Good acting from a good cast of characters and whilst some of the henchmen are a bit silly, their larger than life presence adds some surprises into what is otherwise pretty standard fare. Good pacing, music and fight scenes keep it entertaining throughout, although the start is pretty slow and the ending rather abrupt."
"The Beekeeper","olcare","10 January 2024",NA,"I mean, I don't know what to say; it feels like the movie's script was randomly written without any thought. The events are so poorly explained that I couldn't believe it while watching. I have no idea how they shot it. I'm addressing everyone who watched and gave good ratings: watch it again, life is not that simple.I want to mention Jason Statham. The only good thing in the movie is Jason. He is more than an actor; he's an excellent athlete, continuing this for years and elevating all the action scenes in every action movie. In some fight scenes in this film, extras stand there taking hits flatly, and it's entirely the fault of those who planned the scenes.There's no recognizable plot; the character just walks straight into the president of some made-up country's house, kills 30 people, and we watch this for 1 hour and 40 minutes. The FBI is portrayed as if it's a village organization; the detectives hang out like it's their dad's farm. It's unbelievable. They wrote a movie without sitting down and thinking about these details; it's astonishing.The Beekeeper program is constantly mentioned in the film, but what is it? What do these people do? How were they trained? What hardships did they endure? None of it is there; they just expect us to believe in a name. There's nothing about how the top-secret deadly agents of the government are trained.Money theft and the presidential race are portrayed like child's play. These are not people you can easily reach; to blow up a building or enter the president's mansion, you need an incredibly good script, and this film has none of that.The acting is also bad, except for Jason Statham. There's no good performance except him. The character's motivation is bad too; killing 100 people because a woman who treated him well while beekeeping shot herself. We should have seen a 3-5 minute segment about their intimacy.I don't know what else to say; it just goes on and on, complete bulls**t. I'm thinking about David Ayer's early works, and nowadays, each film he makes is dragging everything further down. The screenwriter, Kurt Wimmer, has also messed up; he wrote it thoughtlessly. I'm eagerly anticipating the film's complete failure at the box office. Definitely a waste of time.."
"The Beekeeper","UniqueParticle","11 January 2024",NA,"So glad I got to see an early screening in imax on 1-6-24 just couldn't review yet. Anyway such an enriching thrill ride to satisfy any action fan of badass one man army types kinda like John Wick with a different style to it! I've been a fan of Jason Statham for a couple decades now and this is one of his best. The writing is magnificent too Kurt Whimmer is perfect for in depth action extravaganza.For an autistic person that's been scammed numerous times Beekeeper hit the spot; I absolutely loved the way everything played out. Well directed, crystal smooth writing, amazing story and top notch action; highly recommend I'll definitely want to own in 4K!"
"The Beekeeper","dam-24421","31 January 2024",NA,"They forgot to write a script? Or bring their head along in this movie?Nothing seemed to work, acting, storyline, everything was so rushed. The actors were incredibly bad, especially Parker. That must be some of the most cringe, b acting I have ever seen. It was unwatchable, I stayed in the cinema because I had my little brother with me, and wouldn't be rude and interfere with the other people in the cinema.This movies gets -3/10Way too cheesy and cringe. David Ayer this is a redo, better luck next time. My sincere condolences for the people watching.Just another movie for the money, so sad."
"The Beekeeper","petercarlsson-92297","30 January 2024",NA,"Jason Statham does the same movie - again - that he's been doing the last 20 years. This time without a script. They just stacked a number of fight and action scenes on top of each other, then called it a movie.Statham has done a few rather good movies like this. For example ""Homefront"". That movie had a script and good acting. But this... What is this? Is it made for teenage boys? For adults? For girls? Boys? I don't know, but the result is nothing new, nothing thrilling and nothing fun.So what do we got. Well, that's a really good question. The problem is that there's very, very hard to find a good answer."
"The Beekeeper","Brillfury","13 January 2024",NA,"Look,I love a good action flick as much as anyone, and Jason Statham is usually awesome. But sadly director David Ayer delivers what will probably be one of the worst movies of 2024. Ayer made one great movie over 20 years ago (Training Day) and also delivered a good flick in Fury, but everything else he makes is horrible. I will admit I did get a kick out of how dumb and goofy this movie is, and laughed a lot. Statham's character is like a cardboard box, it's so boring. Yes his fighting scenes are very cool but he's played awesome characters before that also had a bit of kick. In this movie he gives us nothing.Phylicia Rashad looks fabulous and gets about 5 minutes of screen time. Jeremy Irons and Josh Hutcherson do a great job but their talents are wasted in this movie.The plot starts out really promising...who wouldn't love to see a revenge action movie where the evil call centers get justice? But sadly the premise is wasted.Oh if you love hearing the word ""Beekeeper"" and references to bees you'll love this.The dialogue in this movie is so corny. It's almost like a satire of action movies at some points.In David Ayer's world, nothing works like it actually does in the real world. It is so goofy the way he portrays everything. And this is something he does in a lot of his movies. Just dumb fictional versions of everything from presidents to agencies to how classified programs work. But I do understand they have to make movies and sometimes make everything really stupid to be entertaining. But this movie takes the cake. For instance, call center scams are a real thing and there are many YouTube videos showing how they operate. But in this movie, the call center office is the most over the top clown spectacle you'll ever see and the actual scam is a ludicrous fictionalized version of how they actually work.The two main FBI agents are portrayed goofy AF and their dialogue is nearly unbearable.Statham's character, the beekeeper, doesn't want you to steal from old people but he has no qualms with murdering about 50 federal law enforcement officers in the course of the movie without batting an eye.So if you are about 13 years old this movie will be the coolest thing you've seen but anywhere over that and it's just too dumb. Maybe when it's on streaming it might be fun to watch and make fun of on a rainy day."
"The Beekeeper","TheNamelessCzar","27 January 2024",NA,"This may be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in the theater. I should've known better knowing I was going to see a Jason Statham movie. He has no talent, and he simply is known for his name and his action/fighting skills. But the reviews were so good! Apparently, the reviewers were paid off. The plot is ridiculous, and the acting skills were as bad as a high school drama club,. At times, I felt like I was watching ann episode of NOVA learning all sorts of things about bees. Statham has one facial expression in the movie, and it looks like boredom. Never again will I see on of his movie sin the theater... I'll wait to bore myself at home when it comes on streaming instead."
"The Beekeeper","masonsaul","13 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper isn't as tight or condensed as the films it borrows from thanks to an unexpectedly dense mythology but it really delivers where it counts. It's essentially Jason Statham beating people up for 100 minutes and it never gets old. Thankfully it doesn't really sequel bait however more of these would definitely be welcome.Jason Statham is never bad even when he's in a dud like a few of his recent films. Even so, it's nice to see his talent and physicality employed in something actually good. Jeremy Irons has the ability to deliver exposition about beekeeping in an engaging manner and Josh Hutcherson is actually awake for this one.Similarly to Statham, David Ayer has had a few misses so it's equally rewarding to see him back doing what he knows best whilst showing he and his team are really good at hand to hand combat. The score by David Sardy & Jared Michael Fry is a huge part of why this works, treating the dumbest twists with the utmost seriousness."
"The Beekeeper","masonfisk","30 January 2024",NA,"The first film of the year may rank as one of the worst for the same as Jason Statham kicks butts & takes names (or is it the other way around?) in this goofy revenge tale. Statham, a former government operative, has retired plying his trade running an apiary on a retired woman's property, Phylicia Rashad, but after she commits suicide after being ripped off by some internet sharks prompting Statham to spew bad bee puns while he kills his way to the top (or bottom, these people are scum!) in a concern which runs right to the heights of the White House as the president's, Gemma Redgrave, (from Howard's End) son, played by Josh Hutcherson, is raking in millions from duped customers which will not stand as far as Statham is concerned. David Ayer, a mismatched director for this material (was Shane Black busy?), directs a particularly goofy premise from scenarist David Wimmer, does not help a whit w/humorless Statham doing the physical lifting w/o any issues but the unintentional guffaws generated from villains who look like extras from The Terminator's Tech-noir dance club scene makes this memorable outing for the wrong reasons. Also starring Oscar winner Jeremy Irons as Redgrave's handler, Oscar nominee Minnie Driver (wasted frankly!) as a government contact & Emmy Raver-Lampman (from The Umbrella Academy) who plays Rashad's daughter."
"The Beekeeper","timeblank","21 January 2024",NA,"I fell victim to a scam, and it's satisfying to see scammers getting their due in the Beekeeper movie. Jason Statham's action-packed destruction of the building and culprits is glorious. Despite the absurd plot, the theme of justice prevails. The constant investigation of Statham's crimes is annoying, and the movie's direction raises many questions. The initial 30 minutes were captivating, but the eventual disappointment left me perplexed. Nonetheless, I still enjoyed the movie, even with its absurdities.Beekeeper seems like a John Wick movie - I acknowledge the similarities, but it's purely for entertainment, nothing beyond that!"
"The Beekeeper","slydon13","21 January 2024",NA,"When you see the opening credits - Minnie Driver, Jeremy Irons and Phylicia Rashad - the possiblity exists that this could be worth watching. Ms Driver only had the 2 scenes so she didn't have to be paid as much to surrender her dignity to keep a straight face . Jeremy Irons had to work much harder.The target audience is presumably teenage boys who don't expect or need a script. I presume the 3 actors named above where offered ridiculous money to be part of this enterprise. They are the comprobable film to the Hallmark Christmas movie (with everything pretty much similar to the cookie cutter used for all the previous examples )Presumably they had X number of required explosions , Y in the stunt crew, calculated Z as the number of scenes with a few gaps for words (lets not call it a script)The industry needs these kind of 'Expendeble' wholy forgettable flic to fill in.I only went to see this because I had a free ticket and if I had actually PAID money to see this, I'd likely be angry at my choice or disappointed.There are lots of better old films from the 30s, 40s, 50 etc .

Ofcourse the story didn't delayed and started immediately with a scam and then Jason went on killing spree.The first few actions were a bit relatable and ok but then the story became from good to bad and then worse when the president of USA showed up and the secret service could not even did the job they always were regarded as highly and that js to secure and save the president. No character building and not much of investigation.Its a one man show and the most irritating were those two FBI agents who for no reason were cracking boring jokes on each other and eve though they had chances but never cared to shoot him.The main villain who is again another immature gen z character who js always high on drugs was easily having drugs within the presidential house and killed the fbi director as if nothing to worry about.Damn boring boring and repetitive.

Director David Ayer isn't a filmmaker I really like but I have enjoyed a few of his works like Training Day and End of Watch. His previous movie The Tax Collector was absolutely atrocious but The Beekeeper is slightly better than his last movie.Many of the action thrills, stunts, moments and scenes were ridiculous but for the most part, well-executed and shot pretty well. Although with some mix of poor editing and bad uses of CGI. All the performances were okay as Jason Statham still plays himself but still the fun aspect of the movie. The narrative is pretty ridiculous and kind of dumb where the more you think about it, the more dumber it becomes. The style definitely takes a bit too much influence on the John Wick series and some of the dialogue is quite laughable. But hey, all in all, I did enjoy some moments because it clearly doesn't take itself too seriously and the actions, thrills and Statham being himself was pretty fun."
"The Beekeeper","kmkevinn-64733","12 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper buzzes with intensity as it unveils a gripping tale of vengeance that transcends personal vendettas to impact an entire nation. The film takes you on a relentless journey with one man, a former operative of the enigmatic 'Beekeepers.' What begins as a brutal campaign for personal justice quickly escalates into a high-stakes thriller with national consequences. The storytelling is a masterclass maybe mediocre in suspense, weaving a web of intrigue and unveiling layers of a clandestine organization. The protagonist's journey from a solitary avenger to a player in a larger, more dangerous game is both compelling, almost average and chilling. The Beekeeper delivers not only on the promise of riveting action but also explores the shadowy realms of power and conspiracy, making it a must-watch for any fans of gripping thrillers with a touch of espionage intrigue.

Like the director just cut in the middle of a shot and said, ""screw it, let's go home.""(1 viewing, early screening UltraScreen 1/6/2024)"
"The Beekeeper","Neptune165","2 February 2024",NA,"Just when you think we have reached the bottom of filmmaking ... there is always something like this flick just to prove you can do a lot worse! It s so bland. The FBI agent was not professional and dressed and sounded dumb, lost mom by suicidal act and that did not play much of a roll after the incident,, the villains sounded stupid, especially the dip shots from the call centers. The story idea was great, Jason was awesome but the rest of the actors failed to bring it home. This movie is a terrible revenge story. The idea that Beekeepers are the most elite, well-trained, best equipped one man army is so over-used. The most unbelievable part is that he is hunted by mercenaries, law enforcement, and other Beekeepers. The acting is terrible, the storyline is worse."
"The Beekeeper","BA_Harrison","12 January 2024",NA,"After Fast X and The Meg 2, I swore I wouldn't waste any more of my time on Jason Statham movies, but the trailer for The Beekeeper looked good, so I thought I would give him one last chance. I just hoped that I wouldn't get stung again.Thankfully, this action flick from director David Ayer is as sweet as honey: it's unpretentious, over-the-top, gloriously violent nonsense that isn't to be taken seriously... the film is all about how many people the star can kill or maim during the 1hr 45minute runtime (the answer: a lot!).Statham plays Adam Clay, a beekeeper in more ways than one: he looks after bee hives on the farm owned by kindly Eloise Parker (Phylicia Rashad), but he's also a retired special operative known as a 'beekeeper', part of a government programme so secret even the FBI doesn't know about it. When Eloise loses all of her savings to scammers and commits suicide, Adam isn't a happy man and goes after those responsible, the trail leading all the way to the President of the United States (Jemma Redgrave).Buildings are blown up, limbs are broken, body parts are severed, people are shot, but Adam barely gets a scratch -- those looking for realism should look elsewhere. There's even a scene where a female beekeeper uses a mini-gun mounted on the back of a truck, and mini-guns always equal fun.At the end of the day, Adam makes the bad guys pay for their crimes, and promptly escapes, presumably to set up some more bee hives (the villains having shot up his earlier ones) and to prepare for the inevitable sequel."
"The Beekeeper","imseeg","12 January 2024",NA,"I was excited to see a new action movie with Jason Statham (one of my favorite ACTION actors) and although his figting scenes are still okay (ish), they weren't exhilirating. But there is something worse...The bad: Jason Statham (although in a leading role) doesnt get much screen time. A lot of the time we ONLY get to see a bunch of bland FBI agents, who arent impressing me in any way with their subpar acting performances.Nor do these FBI agents come across as credible by the way, constantly missing Jason Statham when they have all the time and opportunity to kill him point blank. Quite silly.More bad: the other supporting actors are really bad though, But they (AS WELL) do get a lot of screentime. So annoying.Not any good? Actor Jeremy Irons nails it. He plays the role of a cunning sophisticated bad guy and he is terrific. But what the heck is the distinguished and superb actor Jeremy Irons doing in such a cheap looking action movie? HE is the only redeeming feature of this movie though, besides a few action scenes with Jason Statham.Jason Statham fans beware, this one is quite a dud. Tedious, lame, uneventful."
"The Beekeeper","Xavier_Stone","10 January 2024",NA,"Written by Kurt Wimmer who is known for The Expendables which seems about right. Nearly all action which was ok, yet the story is just trash. If you're a fan of Jason then this one is just another average film with his stunts and fighting.Other than that the movie lacks any seriousness and the law enforcement roles are comical and everyone just comes out looking like keystone cops. It could have been so much better with a decent director and a lot of tweaks in the script.Sadly, not enough going on here to please anything but the Jason fans. 3 stars for action, zero for everything else. Even the ending is a zero. Park your brain before watching, no thinking required."
"The Beekeeper","martinrobertson300482","28 January 2024",NA,"Not sure why i went to see this one as i've not seen most of Jason Stathams movies. And if they're anything like this one i won't be in a rush to revisit them.The movie looked dumb, and it is. Statham is a beekeeper. Both metaphorically and genuinely. Infact the worst part of the film isn't how repetitive and boring the action gets (where Statham is practically untouchable). But the cringey push to make ex-military beekeeper tough guys a thing. You'll definitely get some laughs from how ridiculous it all is. But half the time I couldn't really tell if they were intentional laughs or not.I guess there is enough decent action. Like the farm scene, the middle office attack, and there's a decent brutal fight scene near the end. But even the most promising part of the movie - setting up the great villian for a well deserved ass kicking later. Doesn't pay off. So overall, pretty poor."
"The Beekeeper","banzoozalreviews","12 January 2024",NA,"David Ayer's ""The Beekeeper"" has Jason Statham going full John Wick and full Equalizer. This movie is 90 odd minutes of relentless, unhinged, pure escapist fun, with Statham doing what he does best - taking out bad guys like it's nothing and looking uber cool while doing it. He does that here in spades, in the most brutal and ridiculously entertaining ways. Yes, you need to throw believability aside, but if you are a fan of 80s and 90s action thrillers where it's one man against all, you will love this, just like I did. This movie really was a blast and a half, and then some. A great way to start 2024 movie season. I loved it. Pure escapist entertainment."
"The Beekeeper","kuner-59029","14 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper attempts to copy the John Wick formula to the point of plagiarism.The setup is virtually the same. Statham, playing himself as usual, is retired and extremely dangerous ex-assassin, member of a secret group called ""Beekeepers"". He get pulled out of retirement over a seemingly minor incident, and the conflict escalates.A woman he sells honey to (played by the mom from the Cosby Show) commits suicide after having her savings stolen by a scammer company.He takes revenge for her, but oh no, the company belongs to the president's no-good son (similar to the Russian Mob boss's son in the John Wick original).He fights his way to the top through many neon-lit setpieces until he reaches the final boss. The end.However, unlike John Wick, there is none of the fascinating world building, none of the flair, none of the great music editing, much of the acting is awful, and so the whole thing comes apart at the seams. Tonally, the film never hits the mark. Scenes variate between overacted and ridiculous to boring, slow paced and TV series like. Every time the narrative switches to a female FBI agent, the air is sucked out of the movie, and energy comes to a grinding halt.The use of music is awful. It alternates between Batman knock off cello and contrabass strings, which don't fit at all, to house and electronic in scenes where it doesn't fit either. It worked in John Wick, because it was woven into the story. John Wick was either in a night club, or the music was played on the Assassin's radio station. Here it just comes out of nowhere.There are a few good kills. The car off the drawbridge early on is excellent. The final boss fight was decent, but not over the top enough to be memorable.Overall, this is a poorly made film that you will forget the moment you finish it. It's barely watchable, but I deducted points for plagiarism."
"The Beekeeper","sbweightman","12 January 2024",NA,"A really enjoyable revenge action film full of fast paced action and corny bee-related dialogue. Although the character's backstory has been done many times before, the plot has some modern ideas and modern villains which are easy to hate and the strong moral message was quite refreshing. Good acting from a good cast of characters and whilst some of the henchmen are a bit silly, their larger than life presence adds some surprises into what is otherwise pretty standard fare. Good pacing, music and fight scenes keep it entertaining throughout, although the start is pretty slow and the ending rather abrupt."
"The Beekeeper","olcare","10 January 2024",NA,"I mean, I don't know what to say; it feels like the movie's script was randomly written without any thought. The events are so poorly explained that I couldn't believe it while watching. I have no idea how they shot it. I'm addressing everyone who watched and gave good ratings: watch it again, life is not that simple.I want to mention Jason Statham. The only good thing in the movie is Jason. He is more than an actor; he's an excellent athlete, continuing this for years and elevating all the action scenes in every action movie. In some fight scenes in this film, extras stand there taking hits flatly, and it's entirely the fault of those who planned the scenes.There's no recognizable plot; the character just walks straight into the president of some made-up country's house, kills 30 people, and we watch this for 1 hour and 40 minutes. The FBI is portrayed as if it's a village organization; the detectives hang out like it's their dad's farm. It's unbelievable. They wrote a movie without sitting down and thinking about these details; it's astonishing.The Beekeeper program is constantly mentioned in the film, but what is it? What do these people do? How were they trained? What hardships did they endure? None of it is there; they just expect us to believe in a name. There's nothing about how the top-secret deadly agents of the government are trained.Money theft and the presidential race are portrayed like child's play. These are not people you can easily reach; to blow up a building or enter the president's mansion, you need an incredibly good script, and this film has none of that.The acting is also bad, except for Jason Statham. There's no good performance except him. The character's motivation is bad too; killing 100 people because a woman who treated him well while beekeeping shot herself. We should have seen a 3-5 minute segment about their intimacy.I don't know what else to say; it just goes on and on, complete bulls**t. I'm thinking about David Ayer's early works, and nowadays, each film he makes is dragging everything further down. The screenwriter, Kurt Wimmer, has also messed up; he wrote it thoughtlessly. I'm eagerly anticipating the film's complete failure at the box office. Definitely a waste of time.."
"The Beekeeper","UniqueParticle","11 January 2024",NA,"So glad I got to see an early screening in imax on 1-6-24 just couldn't review yet. Anyway such an enriching thrill ride to satisfy any action fan of badass one man army types kinda like John Wick with a different style to it! I've been a fan of Jason Statham for a couple decades now and this is one of his best. The writing is magnificent too Kurt Whimmer is perfect for in depth action extravaganza.For an autistic person that's been scammed numerous times Beekeeper hit the spot; I absolutely loved the way everything played out. Well directed, crystal smooth writing, amazing story and top notch action; highly recommend I'll definitely want to own in 4K!"
"The Beekeeper","dam-24421","31 January 2024",NA,"They forgot to write a script? Or bring their head along in this movie?Nothing seemed to work, acting, storyline, everything was so rushed. The actors were incredibly bad, especially Parker. That must be some of the most cringe, b acting I have ever seen. It was unwatchable, I stayed in the cinema because I had my little brother with me, and wouldn't be rude and interfere with the other people in the cinema.This movies gets -3/10Way too cheesy and cringe. David Ayer this is a redo, better luck next time. My sincere condolences for the people watching.Just another movie for the money, so sad."
"The Beekeeper","petercarlsson-92297","30 January 2024",NA,"Jason Statham does the same movie - again - that he's been doing the last 20 years. This time without a script. They just stacked a number of fight and action scenes on top of each other, then called it a movie.Statham has done a few rather good movies like this. For example ""Homefront"". That movie had a script and good acting. But this... What is this? Is it made for teenage boys? For adults? For girls? Boys? I don't know, but the result is nothing new, nothing thrilling and nothing fun.So what do we got. Well, that's a really good question. The problem is that there's very, very hard to find a good answer."
"The Beekeeper","Brillfury","13 January 2024",NA,"Look,I love a good action flick as much as anyone, and Jason Statham is usually awesome. But sadly director David Ayer delivers what will probably be one of the worst movies of 2024. Ayer made one great movie over 20 years ago (Training Day) and also delivered a good flick in Fury, but everything else he makes is horrible. I will admit I did get a kick out of how dumb and goofy this movie is, and laughed a lot. Statham's character is like a cardboard box, it's so boring. Yes his fighting scenes are very cool but he's played awesome characters before that also had a bit of kick. In this movie he gives us nothing.Phylicia Rashad looks fabulous and gets about 5 minutes of screen time. Jeremy Irons and Josh Hutcherson do a great job but their talents are wasted in this movie.The plot starts out really promising...who wouldn't love to see a revenge action movie where the evil call centers get justice? But sadly the premise is wasted.Oh if you love hearing the word ""Beekeeper"" and references to bees you'll love this.The dialogue in this movie is so corny. It's almost like a satire of action movies at some points.In David Ayer's world, nothing works like it actually does in the real world. It is so goofy the way he portrays everything. And this is something he does in a lot of his movies. Just dumb fictional versions of everything from presidents to agencies to how classified programs work. But I do understand they have to make movies and sometimes make everything really stupid to be entertaining. But this movie takes the cake. For instance, call center scams are a real thing and there are many YouTube videos showing how they operate. But in this movie, the call center office is the most over the top clown spectacle you'll ever see and the actual scam is a ludicrous fictionalized version of how they actually work.The two main FBI agents are portrayed goofy AF and their dialogue is nearly unbearable.Statham's character, the beekeeper, doesn't want you to steal from old people but he has no qualms with murdering about 50 federal law enforcement officers in the course of the movie without batting an eye.So if you are about 13 years old this movie will be the coolest thing you've seen but anywhere over that and it's just too dumb. Maybe when it's on streaming it might be fun to watch and make fun of on a rainy day."
"The Beekeeper","TheNamelessCzar","27 January 2024",NA,"This may be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in the theater. I should've known better knowing I was going to see a Jason Statham movie. He has no talent, and he simply is known for his name and his action/fighting skills. But the reviews were so good! Apparently, the reviewers were paid off. The plot is ridiculous, and the acting skills were as bad as a high school drama club,. At times, I felt like I was watching ann episode of NOVA learning all sorts of things about bees. Statham has one facial expression in the movie, and it looks like boredom. Never again will I see on of his movie sin the theater... I'll wait to bore myself at home when it comes on streaming instead."
"The Beekeeper","masonsaul","13 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper isn't as tight or condensed as the films it borrows from thanks to an unexpectedly dense mythology but it really delivers where it counts. It's essentially Jason Statham beating people up for 100 minutes and it never gets old. Thankfully it doesn't really sequel bait however more of these would definitely be welcome.Jason Statham is never bad even when he's in a dud like a few of his recent films. Even so, it's nice to see his talent and physicality employed in something actually good. Jeremy Irons has the ability to deliver exposition about beekeeping in an engaging manner and Josh Hutcherson is actually awake for this one.Similarly to Statham, David Ayer has had a few misses so it's equally rewarding to see him back doing what he knows best whilst showing he and his team are really good at hand to hand combat. The score by David Sardy & Jared Michael Fry is a huge part of why this works, treating the dumbest twists with the utmost seriousness."
"The Beekeeper","masonfisk","30 January 2024",NA,"The first film of the year may rank as one of the worst for the same as Jason Statham kicks butts & takes names (or is it the other way around?) in this goofy revenge tale. Statham, a former government operative, has retired plying his trade running an apiary on a retired woman's property, Phylicia Rashad, but after she commits suicide after being ripped off by some internet sharks prompting Statham to spew bad bee puns while he kills his way to the top (or bottom, these people are scum!) in a concern which runs right to the heights of the White House as the president's, Gemma Redgrave, (from Howard's End) son, played by Josh Hutcherson, is raking in millions from duped customers which will not stand as far as Statham is concerned. David Ayer, a mismatched director for this material (was Shane Black busy?), directs a particularly goofy premise from scenarist David Wimmer, does not help a whit w/humorless Statham doing the physical lifting w/o any issues but the unintentional guffaws generated from villains who look like extras from The Terminator's Tech-noir dance club scene makes this memorable outing for the wrong reasons. Also starring Oscar winner Jeremy Irons as Redgrave's handler, Oscar nominee Minnie Driver (wasted frankly!) as a government contact & Emmy Raver-Lampman (from The Umbrella Academy) who plays Rashad's daughter."
"The Beekeeper","timeblank","21 January 2024",NA,"I fell victim to a scam, and it's satisfying to see scammers getting their due in the Beekeeper movie. Jason Statham's action-packed destruction of the building and culprits is glorious. Despite the absurd plot, the theme of justice prevails. The constant investigation of Statham's crimes is annoying, and the movie's direction raises many questions. The initial 30 minutes were captivating, but the eventual disappointment left me perplexed. Nonetheless, I still enjoyed the movie, even with its absurdities.Beekeeper seems like a John Wick movie - I acknowledge the similarities, but it's purely for entertainment, nothing beyond that!"
"The Beekeeper","slydon13","21 January 2024",NA,"When you see the opening credits - Minnie Driver, Jeremy Irons and Phylicia Rashad - the possiblity exists that this could be worth watching. Ms Driver only had the 2 scenes so she didn't have to be paid as much to surrender her dignity to keep a straight face . Jeremy Irons had to work much harder.The target audience is presumably teenage boys who don't expect or need a script. I presume the 3 actors named above where offered ridiculous money to be part of this enterprise. They are the comprobable film to the Hallmark Christmas movie (with everything pretty much similar to the cookie cutter used for all the previous examples )Presumably they had X number of required explosions , Y in the stunt crew, calculated Z as the number of scenes with a few gaps for words (lets not call it a script)The industry needs these kind of 'Expendeble' wholy forgettable flic to fill in.I only went to see this because I had a free ticket and if I had actually PAID money to see this, I'd likely be angry at my choice or disappointed.There are lots of better old films from the 30s, 40s, 50 etc .

Ofcourse the story didn't delayed and started immediately with a scam and then Jason went on killing spree.The first few actions were a bit relatable and ok but then the story became from good to bad and then worse when the president of USA showed up and the secret service could not even did the job they always were regarded as highly and that js to secure and save the president. No character building and not much of investigation.Its a one man show and the most irritating were those two FBI agents who for no reason were cracking boring jokes on each other and eve though they had chances but never cared to shoot him.The main villain who is again another immature gen z character who js always high on drugs was easily having drugs within the presidential house and killed the fbi director as if nothing to worry about.Damn boring boring and repetitive. All characters were so boring and irritable in nature.The best scene was the ending when i left my seat."
"The Beekeeper","chenp-54708","12 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper is one of those dumb stupid action movies that are so ridiculously dumb, yet still has some strong parts. Director David Ayer isn't a filmmaker I really like but I have enjoyed a few of his works like Training Day and End of Watch. His previous movie The Tax Collector was absolutely atrocious but The Beekeeper is slightly better than his last movie.Many of the action thrills, stunts, moments and scenes were ridiculous but for the most part, well-executed and shot pretty well. Although with some mix of poor editing and bad uses of CGI. All the performances were okay as Jason Statham still plays himself but still the fun aspect of the movie. The narrative is pretty ridiculous and kind of dumb where the more you think about it, the more dumber it becomes. The style definitely takes a bit too much influence on the John Wick series and some of the dialogue is quite laughable. But hey, all in all, I did enjoy some moments because it clearly doesn't take itself too seriously and the actions, thrills and Statham being himself was pretty fun."
"The Beekeeper","kmkevinn-64733","12 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper buzzes with intensity as it unveils a gripping tale of vengeance that transcends personal vendettas to impact an entire nation. The film takes you on a relentless journey with one man, a former operative of the enigmatic 'Beekeepers.' What begins as a brutal campaign for personal justice quickly escalates into a high-stakes thriller with national consequences. The storytelling is a masterclass maybe mediocre in suspense, weaving a web of intrigue and unveiling layers of a clandestine organization. The protagonist's journey from a solitary avenger to a player in a larger, more dangerous game is both compelling, almost average and chilling. The Beekeeper delivers not only on the promise of riveting action but also explores the shadowy realms of power and conspiracy, making it a must-watch for any fans of gripping thrillers with a touch of espionage intrigue. The 6/10 is appropriate."
"The Beekeeper","DocteurDream","30 January 2024",NA,"Verona Parker is easily one of the worst characters ever written for the screen, takes away everything this movie aspires to be. The actress also did a piss poor job and always had me cringing at the unrealistic and unreasonable choices she makes. If you'd delete that character entirely, this movie would've been a whole lot better in the long run.Subject wise it's a very nice concept of a revenge thriller against scam call centers- but again, the whole govt mumbo jumbo makes it feel a whole run of the mill action BS from Hollywood mid tier movies. If the story had been awhole lot grounded, it would've done a whole lot better imo."
"The Beekeeper","kjproulx","12 January 2024",NA,"By now, audiences should realize what they are in for when it comes to Jason Statham leading an action film. The Beekeeper is the latest film to continue his long-running legacy of action flicks and it's quite a bit of fun. It's very far from an awards nominee, but for a film I had zero expectations for, and for being as cheesy as it is, it's pretty good. Take that as you will because I will be diving into things that are also pretty bad as well. The cheesiness of this film will turn some people off, but I was able to ignore it. Here's why I recommend The Beekeeper if you want to watch a new action-packed film to enjoy and not have to think too much about.The ""Beekeepers"" is an organization of hitmen who take out criminals. Jason Statham plays Adam Clay, a retiree from this organization, who is on a manhunt for everyone involved in scamming a woman he cared for, which led to her suicide. It's as simple as that. There are multiple bosses in this company, so it's like watching a sophisticated video game being played out. The action sequences are well-choreographed and there are quite a few action scenes, so overall, this film was a blast to watch. With that said, the dialogue from beginning to end it pretty atrocious.If the script had been reworked, I think this could've been a surprisingly great film as a whole. Sadly, the dialogue is full of Bee puns that fall flat almost every time, even with solid actors delivering them. The character arc and dialogue for Josh Hutcherson's Derek Danforth (who is the main villain of the film) is laughable, and not really in a good way. His whiny, self-entitled performance was great and I liked that he was giving this character his all, it's just that, again, the dialogue sucks. The lines everyone was saying took me out of the experience many times. Still, there is a lot of great action, and that's what I wanted from a movie like this anyway. I'm sure the dialogue will have people hating this movie and I'm equally sure certain people will find it hilarious. I'm kind of in the middle.The Beekeeper is David Ayer's latest directorial effort and as always, he does a great job with action. His touch as a director is always welcomed by me and the neon look to the film was cool as well. It's a cool film to watch and it's aesthetically pleasing. I may be ripping apart the script, but it's just the dialogue. The story itself plays out nicely and has a nice resolution. I was looking for a fun action film and this film delivered that, despite its downfalls. I say check it out."
"The Beekeeper","FeastMode","12 January 2024",NA,"I seem to use that headline a lot. I guess it's better than a bad movie with bad fight scenes.Starting with the good, Statham is awesome as usual. And I loved all of the fight scenes. They are ridiculously fast yet completely clear. It's hard hitting, you can feel the blows. This is enhanced by the beastly IMAX speakers. And with the R-rating, it doesn't hold back. Although it's far from gratuitous.The bad? Sigh. The non-action scenes, which make up the majority of the movie, range from average to terrible. The quality level feels like a streaming movie, not a theatrical one. I spent much of the runtime uninterested and unengaged.Everything feels off. The dialogue is weird. The acting is questionable. And there are a bunch of dumb things that strain believability. Like the entire bad guy organization. Or a laugh-out-loud idiotic character decision during the climax. A true ""are you kidding me?"" moment.Even the cut to credits felt odd.

It could have been so much better with a decent director and a lot of tweaks in the script.Sadly, not enough going on here to please anything but the Jason fans. 3 stars for action, zero for everything else. Even the ending is a zero. Park your brain before watching, no thinking required."
"The Beekeeper","martinrobertson300482","28 January 2024",NA,"Not sure why i went to see this one as i've not seen most of Jason Stathams movies. And if they're anything like this one i won't be in a rush to revisit them.The movie looked dumb, and it is. Statham is a beekeeper. Both metaphorically and genuinely. Infact the worst part of the film isn't how repetitive and boring the action gets (where Statham is practically untouchable). But the cringey push to make ex-military beekeeper tough guys a thing. You'll definitely get some laughs from how ridiculous it all is. But half the time I couldn't really tell if they were intentional laughs or not.I guess there is enough decent action. Like the farm scene, the middle office attack, and there's a decent brutal fight scene near the end. But even the most promising part of the movie - setting up the great villian for a well deserved ass kicking later. Doesn't pay off. So overall, pretty poor."
"The Beekeeper","banzoozalreviews","12 January 2024",NA,"David Ayer's ""The Beekeeper"" has Jason Statham going full John Wick and full Equalizer. This movie is 90 odd minutes of relentless, unhinged, pure escapist fun, with Statham doing what he does best - taking out bad guys like it's nothing and looking uber cool while doing it. He does that here in spades, in the most brutal and ridiculously entertaining ways. Yes, you need to throw believability aside, but if you are a fan of 80s and 90s action thrillers where it's one man against all, you will love this, just like I did. This movie really was a blast and a half, and then some. A great way to start 2024 movie season. I loved it. Pure escapist entertainment."
"The Beekeeper","kuner-59029","14 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper attempts to copy the John Wick formula to the point of plagiarism.The setup is virtually the same. Statham, playing himself as usual, is retired and extremely dangerous ex-assassin, member of a secret group called ""Beekeepers"". He get pulled out of retirement over a seemingly minor incident, and the conflict escalates.A woman he sells honey to (played by the mom from the Cosby Show) commits suicide after having her savings stolen by a scammer company.He takes revenge for her, but oh no, the company belongs to the president's no-good son (similar to the Russian Mob boss's son in the John Wick original).He fights his way to the top through many neon-lit setpieces until he reaches the final boss. The end.However, unlike John Wick, there is none of the fascinating world building, none of the flair, none of the great music editing, much of the acting is awful, and so the whole thing comes apart at the seams. Tonally, the film never hits the mark. Scenes variate between overacted and ridiculous to boring, slow paced and TV series like. Every time the narrative switches to a female FBI agent, the air is sucked out of the movie, and energy comes to a grinding halt.The use of music is awful. It alternates between Batman knock off cello and contrabass strings, which don't fit at all, to house and electronic in scenes where it doesn't fit either. It worked in John Wick, because it was woven into the story. John Wick was either in a night club, or the music was played on the Assassin's radio station. Here it just comes out of nowhere.There are a few good kills. The car off the drawbridge early on is excellent. The final boss fight was decent, but not over the top enough to be memorable.Overall, this is a poorly made film that you will forget the moment you finish it. It's barely watchable, but I deducted points for plagiarism."
"The Beekeeper","sbweightman","12 January 2024",NA,"A really enjoyable revenge action film full of fast paced action and corny bee-related dialogue. Although the character's backstory has been done many times before, the plot has some modern ideas and modern villains which are easy to hate and the strong moral message was quite refreshing. Good acting from a good cast of characters and whilst some of the henchmen are a bit silly, their larger than life presence adds some surprises into what is otherwise pretty standard fare. Good pacing, music and fight scenes keep it entertaining throughout, although the start is pretty slow and the ending rather abrupt."
"The Beekeeper","olcare","10 January 2024",NA,"I mean, I don't know what to say; it feels like the movie's script was randomly written without any thought. The events are so poorly explained that I couldn't believe it while watching. I have no idea how they shot it. I'm addressing everyone who watched and gave good ratings: watch it again, life is not that simple.I want to mention Jason Statham. The only good thing in the movie is Jason. He is more than an actor; he's an excellent athlete, continuing this for years and elevating all the action scenes in every action movie. In some fight scenes in this film, extras stand there taking hits flatly, and it's entirely the fault of those who planned the scenes.There's no recognizable plot; the character just walks straight into the president of some made-up country's house, kills 30 people, and we watch this for 1 hour and 40 minutes. The FBI is portrayed as if it's a village organization; the detectives hang out like it's their dad's farm. It's unbelievable. They wrote a movie without sitting down and thinking about these details; it's astonishing.The Beekeeper program is constantly mentioned in the film, but what is it? What do these people do? How were they trained? What hardships did they endure? None of it is there; they just expect us to believe in a name. There's nothing about how the top-secret deadly agents of the government are trained.Money theft and the presidential race are portrayed like child's play. These are not people you can easily reach; to blow up a building or enter the president's mansion, you need an incredibly good script, and this film has none of that.The acting is also bad, except for Jason Statham. There's no good performance except him. The character's motivation is bad too; killing 100 people because a woman who treated him well while beekeeping shot herself. We should have seen a 3-5 minute segment about their intimacy.I don't know what else to say; it just goes on and on, complete bulls**t. I'm thinking about David Ayer's early works, and nowadays, each film he makes is dragging everything further down. The screenwriter, Kurt Wimmer, has also messed up; he wrote it thoughtlessly. I'm eagerly anticipating the film's complete failure at the box office. Definitely a waste of time.."
"The Beekeeper","UniqueParticle","11 January 2024",NA,"So glad I got to see an early screening in imax on 1-6-24 just couldn't review yet. Anyway such an enriching thrill ride to satisfy any action fan of badass one man army types kinda like John Wick with a different style to it! I've been a fan of Jason Statham for a couple decades now and this is one of his best. The writing is magnificent too Kurt Whimmer is perfect for in depth action extravaganza.For an autistic person that's been scammed numerous times Beekeeper hit the spot; I absolutely loved the way everything played out. Well directed, crystal smooth writing, amazing story and top notch action; highly recommend I'll definitely want to own in 4K!"
"The Beekeeper","dam-24421","31 January 2024",NA,"They forgot to write a script? Or bring their head along in this movie?Nothing seemed to work, acting, storyline, everything was so rushed. The actors were incredibly bad, especially Parker. That must be some of the most cringe, b acting I have ever seen. It was unwatchable, I stayed in the cinema because I had my little brother with me, and wouldn't be rude and interfere with the other people in the cinema.This movies gets -3/10Way too cheesy and cringe. David Ayer this is a redo, better luck next time. My sincere condolences for the people watching.Just another movie for the money, so sad."
"The Beekeeper","petercarlsson-92297","30 January 2024",NA,"Jason Statham does the same movie - again - that he's been doing the last 20 years. This time without a script. They just stacked a number of fight and action scenes on top of each other, then called it a movie.Statham has done a few rather good movies like this. For example ""Homefront"". That movie had a script and good acting. But this... What is this? Is it made for teenage boys? For adults? For girls? Boys? I don't know, but the result is nothing new, nothing thrilling and nothing fun.So what do we got. Well, that's a really good question. The problem is that there's very, very hard to find a good answer."
"The Beekeeper","Brillfury","13 January 2024",NA,"Look,I love a good action flick as much as anyone, and Jason Statham is usually awesome. But sadly director David Ayer delivers what will probably be one of the worst movies of 2024. Ayer made one great movie over 20 years ago (Training Day) and also delivered a good flick in Fury, but everything else he makes is horrible. I will admit I did get a kick out of how dumb and goofy this movie is, and laughed a lot. Statham's character is like a cardboard box, it's so boring. Yes his fighting scenes are very cool but he's played awesome characters before that also had a bit of kick. In this movie he gives us nothing.Phylicia Rashad looks fabulous and gets about 5 minutes of screen time. Jeremy Irons and Josh Hutcherson do a great job but their talents are wasted in this movie.The plot starts out really promising...who wouldn't love to see a revenge action movie where the evil call centers get justice? But sadly the premise is wasted.Oh if you love hearing the word ""Beekeeper"" and references to bees you'll love this.The dialogue in this movie is so corny. It's almost like a satire of action movies at some points.In David Ayer's world, nothing works like it actually does in the real world. It is so goofy the way he portrays everything. And this is something he does in a lot of his movies. Just dumb fictional versions of everything from presidents to agencies to how classified programs work. But I do understand they have to make movies and sometimes make everything really stupid to be entertaining. But this movie takes the cake. For instance, call center scams are a real thing and there are many YouTube videos showing how they operate. But in this movie, the call center office is the most over the top clown spectacle you'll ever see and the actual scam is a ludicrous fictionalized version of how they actually work.The two main FBI agents are portrayed goofy AF and their dialogue is nearly unbearable.Statham's character, the beekeeper, doesn't want you to steal from old people but he has no qualms with murdering about 50 federal law enforcement officers in the course of the movie without batting an eye.So if you are about 13 years old this movie will be the coolest thing you've seen but anywhere over that and it's just too dumb. Maybe when it's on streaming it might be fun to watch and make fun of on a rainy day."
"The Beekeeper","TheNamelessCzar","27 January 2024",NA,"This may be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in the theater. I should've known better knowing I was going to see a Jason Statham movie. He has no talent, and he simply is known for his name and his action/fighting skills. But the reviews were so good! Apparently, the reviewers were paid off. The plot is ridiculous, and the acting skills were as bad as a high school drama club,. At times, I felt like I was watching ann episode of NOVA learning all sorts of things about bees. Statham has one facial expression in the movie, and it looks like boredom. Never again will I see on of his movie sin the theater... I'll wait to bore myself at home when it comes on streaming instead."
"The Beekeeper","masonsaul","13 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper isn't as tight or condensed as the films it borrows from thanks to an unexpectedly dense mythology but it really delivers where it counts. It's essentially Jason Statham beating people up for 100 minutes and it never gets old. Thankfully it doesn't really sequel bait however more of these would definitely be welcome.Jason Statham is never bad even when he's in a dud like a few of his recent films. Even so, it's nice to see his talent and physicality employed in something actually good. Jeremy Irons has the ability to deliver exposition about beekeeping in an engaging manner and Josh Hutcherson is actually awake for this one.Similarly to Statham, David Ayer has had a few misses so it's equally rewarding to see him back doing what he knows best whilst showing he and his team are really good at hand to hand combat. The score by David Sardy & Jared Michael Fry is a huge part of why this works, treating the dumbest twists with the utmost seriousness."
"The Beekeeper","masonfisk","30 January 2024",NA,"The first film of the year may rank as one of the worst for the same as Jason Statham kicks butts & takes names (or is it the other way around?) in this goofy revenge tale. Statham, a former government operative, has retired plying his trade running an apiary on a retired woman's property, Phylicia Rashad, but after she commits suicide after being ripped off by some internet sharks prompting Statham to spew bad bee puns while he kills his way to the top (or bottom, these people are scum!) in a concern which runs right to the heights of the White House as the president's, Gemma Redgrave, (from Howard's End) son, played by Josh Hutcherson, is raking in millions from duped customers which will not stand as far as Statham is concerned. David Ayer, a mismatched director for this material (was Shane Black busy?), directs a particularly goofy premise from scenarist David Wimmer, does not help a whit w/humorless Statham doing the physical lifting w/o any issues but the unintentional guffaws generated from villains who look like extras from The Terminator's Tech-noir dance club scene makes this memorable outing for the wrong reasons. Also starring Oscar winner Jeremy Irons as Redgrave's handler, Oscar nominee Minnie Driver (wasted frankly!) as a government contact & Emmy Raver-Lampman (from The Umbrella Academy) who plays Rashad's daughter."
"The Beekeeper","timeblank","21 January 2024",NA,"I fell victim to a scam, and it's satisfying to see scammers getting their due in the Beekeeper movie. Jason Statham's action-packed destruction of the building and culprits is glorious. Despite the absurd plot, the theme of justice prevails. The constant investigation of Statham's crimes is annoying, and the movie's direction raises many questions. The initial 30 minutes were captivating, but the eventual disappointment left me perplexed. Nonetheless, I still enjoyed the movie, even with its absurdities.Beekeeper seems like a John Wick movie - I acknowledge the similarities, but it's purely for entertainment, nothing beyond that!"
"The Beekeeper","slydon13","21 January 2024",NA,"When you see the opening credits - Minnie Driver, Jeremy Irons and Phylicia Rashad - the possiblity exists that this could be worth watching. Ms Driver only had the 2 scenes so she didn't have to be paid as much to surrender her dignity to keep a straight face . Jeremy Irons had to work much harder.The target audience is presumably teenage boys who don't expect or need a script. I presume the 3 actors named above where offered ridiculous money to be part of this enterprise. They are the comprobable film to the Hallmark Christmas movie (with everything pretty much similar to the cookie cutter used for all the previous examples )Presumably they had X number of required explosions , Y in the stunt crew, calculated Z as the number of scenes with a few gaps for words (lets not call it a script)The industry needs these kind of 'Expendeble' wholy forgettable flic to fill in.I only went to see this because I had a free ticket and if I had actually PAID money to see this, I'd likely be angry at my choice or disappointed.There are lots of better old films from the 30s, 40s, 50 etc . This was a waste of time but my autistic nephew loves going to the cinema and I'm part of his 'entertainment team'."

"The Beekeeper","samyakrout-65994","24 January 2024",NA,"The only good part the stealth and fitness of Jason Statham.This movie is so bad that where to start. Ofcourse the story didn't delayed and started immediately with a scam and then Jason went on killing spree.The first few actions were a bit relatable and ok but then the story became from good to bad and then worse when the president of USA showed up and the secret service could not even did the job they always were regarded as highly and that js to secure and save the president. No character building and not much of investigation.Its a one man show and the most irritating were those two FBI agents who for no reason were cracking boring jokes on each other and eve though they had chances but never cared to shoot him.The main villain who is again another immature gen z character who js always high on drugs was easily having drugs within the presidential house and killed the fbi director as if nothing to worry about.Damn boring boring and repetitive. All characters were so boring and irritable in nature.The best scene was the ending when i left my seat."
"The Beekeeper","chenp-54708","12 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper is one of those dumb stupid action movies that are so ridiculously dumb, yet still has some strong parts. Director David Ayer isn't a filmmaker I really like but I have enjoyed a few of his works like Training Day and End of Watch. His previous movie The Tax Collector was absolutely atrocious but The Beekeeper is slightly better than his last movie.Many of the action thrills, stunts, moments and scenes were ridiculous but for the most part, well-executed and shot pretty well. Although with some mix of poor editing and bad uses of CGI. All the performances were okay as Jason Statham still plays himself but still the fun aspect of the movie. The narrative is pretty ridiculous and kind of dumb where the more you think about it, the more dumber it becomes. The style definitely takes a bit too much influence on the John Wick series and some of the dialogue is quite laughable. But hey, all in all, I did enjoy some moments because it clearly doesn't take itself too seriously and the actions, thrills and Statham being himself was pretty fun."
"The Beekeeper","kmkevinn-64733","12 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper buzzes with intensity as it unveils a gripping tale of vengeance that transcends personal vendettas to impact an entire nation. The film takes you on a relentless journey with one man, a former operative of the enigmatic 'Beekeepers.' What begins as a brutal campaign for personal justice quickly escalates into a high-stakes thriller with national consequences. The storytelling is a masterclass maybe mediocre in suspense, weaving a web of intrigue and unveiling layers of a clandestine organization. The protagonist's journey from a solitary avenger to a player in a larger, more dangerous game is both compelling, almost average and chilling. The Beekeeper delivers not only on the promise of riveting action but also explores the shadowy realms of power and conspiracy, making it a must-watch for any fans of gripping thrillers with a touch of espionage intrigue. The 6/10 is appropriate."
"The Beekeeper","DocteurDream","30 January 2024",NA,"Verona Parker is easily one of the worst characters ever written for the screen, takes away everything this movie aspires to be. The actress also did a piss poor job and always had me cringing at the unrealistic and unreasonable choices she makes. If you'd delete that character entirely, this movie would've been a whole lot better in the long run.Subject wise it's a very nice concept of a revenge thriller against scam call centers- but again, the whole govt mumbo jumbo makes it feel a whole run of the mill action BS from Hollywood mid tier movies. If the story had been awhole lot grounded, it would've done a whole lot better imo."
"The Beekeeper","kjproulx","12 January 2024",NA,"By now, audiences should realize what they are in for when it comes to Jason Statham leading an action film. The Beekeeper is the latest film to continue his long-running legacy of action flicks and it's quite a bit of fun. It's very far from an awards nominee, but for a film I had zero expectations for, and for being as cheesy as it is, it's pretty good. Take that as you will because I will be diving into things that are also pretty bad as well. The cheesiness of this film will turn some people off, but I was able to ignore it. Here's why I recommend The Beekeeper if you want to watch a new action-packed film to enjoy and not have to think too much about.The ""Beekeepers"" is an organization of hitmen who take out criminals. Jason Statham plays Adam Clay, a retiree from this organization, who is on a manhunt for everyone involved in scamming a woman he cared for, which led to her suicide. It's as simple as that. There are multiple bosses in this company, so it's like watching a sophisticated video game being played out. The action sequences are well-choreographed and there are quite a few action scenes, so overall, this film was a blast to watch. With that said, the dialogue from beginning to end it pretty atrocious.If the script had been reworked, I think this could've been a surprisingly great film as a whole. Sadly, the dialogue is full of Bee puns that fall flat almost every time, even with solid actors delivering them. The character arc and dialogue for Josh Hutcherson's Derek Danforth (who is the main villain of the film) is laughable, and not really in a good way. His whiny, self-entitled performance was great and I liked that he was giving this character his all, it's just that, again, the dialogue sucks. The lines everyone was saying took me out of the experience many times. Still, there is a lot of great action, and that's what I wanted from a movie like this anyway. I'm sure the dialogue will have people hating this movie and I'm equally sure certain people will find it hilarious. I'm kind of in the middle.The Beekeeper is David Ayer's latest directorial effort and as always, he does a great job with action. His touch as a director is always welcomed by me and the neon look to the film was cool as well. It's a cool film to watch and it's aesthetically pleasing. I may be ripping apart the script, but it's just the dialogue. The story itself plays out nicely and has a nice resolution. I was looking for a fun action film and this film delivered that, despite its downfalls. I say check it out."
"The Beekeeper","FeastMode","12 January 2024",NA,"I seem to use that headline a lot. I guess it's better than a bad movie with bad fight scenes.Starting with the good, Statham is awesome as usual. And I loved all of the fight scenes. They are ridiculously fast yet completely clear. It's hard hitting, you can feel the blows. This is enhanced by the beastly IMAX speakers. And with the R-rating, it doesn't hold back. Although it's far from gratuitous.The bad? Sigh. The non-action scenes, which make up the majority of the movie, range from average to terrible. The quality level feels like a streaming movie, not a theatrical one. I spent much of the runtime uninterested and unengaged.Everything feels off. The dialogue is weird. The acting is questionable. And there are a bunch of dumb things that strain believability. Like the entire bad guy organization. Or a laugh-out-loud idiotic character decision during the climax. A true ""are you kidding me?"" moment.Even the cut to credits felt odd. Like the director just cut in the middle of a shot and said, ""screw it, let's go home.""(1 viewing, early screening UltraScreen 1/6/2024)"
"The Beekeeper","Neptune165","2 February 2024",NA,"Just when you think we have reached the bottom of filmmaking ... there is always something like this flick just to prove you can do a lot worse! It s so bland. The FBI agent was not professional and dressed and sounded dumb, lost mom by suicidal act and that did not play much of a roll after the incident,, the villains sounded stupid, especially the dip shots from the call centers. The story idea was great, Jason was awesome but the rest of the actors failed to bring it home. This movie is a terrible revenge story. The idea that Beekeepers are the most elite, well-trained, best equipped one man army is so over-used. The most unbelievable part is that he is hunted by mercenaries, law enforcement, and other Beekeepers. The acting is terrible, the storyline is worse."
"The Beekeeper","BA_Harrison","12 January 2024",NA,"After Fast X and The Meg 2, I swore I wouldn't waste any more of my time on Jason Statham movies, but the trailer for The Beekeeper looked good, so I thought I would give him one last chance. I just hoped that I wouldn't get stung again.Thankfully, this action flick from director David Ayer is as sweet as honey: it's unpretentious, over-the-top, gloriously violent nonsense that isn't to be taken seriously... the film is all about how many people the star can kill or maim during the 1hr 45minute runtime (the answer: a lot!).Statham plays Adam Clay, a beekeeper in more ways than one: he looks after bee hives on the farm owned by kindly Eloise Parker (Phylicia Rashad), but he's also a retired special operative known as a 'beekeeper', part of a government programme so secret even the FBI doesn't know about it. When Eloise loses all of her savings to scammers and commits suicide, Adam isn't a happy man and goes after those responsible, the trail leading all the way to the President of the United States (Jemma Redgrave).Buildings are blown up, limbs are broken, body parts are severed, people are shot, but Adam barely gets a scratch -- those looking for realism should look elsewhere. There's even a scene where a female beekeeper uses a mini-gun mounted on the back of a truck, and mini-guns always equal fun.At the end of the day, Adam makes the bad guys pay for their crimes, and promptly escapes, presumably to set up some more bee hives (the villains having shot up his earlier ones) and to prepare for the inevitable sequel."
"The Beekeeper","imseeg","12 January 2024",NA,"I was excited to see a new action movie with Jason Statham (one of my favorite ACTION actors) and although his figting scenes are still okay (ish), they weren't exhilirating. But there is something worse...The bad: Jason Statham (although in a leading role) doesnt get much screen time. A lot of the time we ONLY get to see a bunch of bland FBI agents, who arent impressing me in any way with their subpar acting performances.Nor do these FBI agents come across as credible by the way, constantly missing Jason Statham when they have all the time and opportunity to kill him point blank. Quite silly.More bad: the other supporting actors are really bad though, But they (AS WELL) do get a lot of screentime. So annoying.Not any good? Actor Jeremy Irons nails it. He plays the role of a cunning sophisticated bad guy and he is terrific. But what the heck is the distinguished and superb actor Jeremy Irons doing in such a cheap looking action movie? HE is the only redeeming feature of this movie though, besides a few action scenes with Jason Statham.Jason Statham fans beware, this one is quite a dud. Tedious, lame, uneventful."

Infact the worst part of the film isn't how repetitive and boring the action gets (where Statham is practically untouchable). But the cringey push to make ex-military beekeeper tough guys a thing. You'll definitely get some laughs from how ridiculous it all is. But half the time I couldn't really tell if they were intentional laughs or not.I guess there is enough decent action. Like the farm scene, the middle office attack, and there's a decent brutal fight scene near the end. But even the most promising part of the movie - setting up the great villian for a well deserved ass kicking later. Doesn't pay off. So overall, pretty poor."
"The Beekeeper","banzoozalreviews","12 January 2024",NA,"David Ayer's ""The Beekeeper"" has Jason Statham going full John Wick and full Equalizer. This movie is 90 odd minutes of relentless, unhinged, pure escapist fun, with Statham doing what he does best - taking out bad guys like it's nothing and looking uber cool while doing it. He does that here in spades, in the most brutal and ridiculously entertaining ways. Yes, you need to throw believability aside, but if you are a fan of 80s and 90s action thrillers where it's one man against all, you will love this, just like I did. This movie really was a blast and a half, and then some. A great way to start 2024 movie season. I loved it. Pure escapist entertainment."

The final boss fight was decent, but not over the top enough to be memorable.Overall, this is a poorly made film that you will forget the moment you finish it. It's barely watchable, but I deducted points for plagiarism."
"The Beekeeper","sbweightman","12 January 2024",NA,"A really enjoyable revenge action film full of fast paced action and corny bee-related dialogue. Although the character's backstory has been done many times before, the plot has some modern ideas and modern villains which are easy to hate and the strong moral message was quite refreshing. Good acting from a good cast of characters and whilst some of the henchmen are a bit silly, their larger than life presence adds some surprises into what is otherwise pretty standard fare. Good pacing, music and fight scenes keep it entertaining throughout, although the start is pretty slow and the ending rather abrupt."
"The Beekeeper","olcare","10 January 2024",NA,"I mean, I don't know what to say; it feels like the movie's script was randomly written without any thought. The events are so poorly explained that I couldn't believe it while watching. I have no idea how they shot it. I'm addressing everyone who watched and gave good ratings: watch it again, life is not that simple.I want to mention Jason Statham. The only good thing in the movie is Jason. He is more than an actor; he's an excellent athlete, continuing this for years and elevating all the action scenes in every action movie. In some fight scenes in this film, extras stand there taking hits flatly, and it's entirely the fault of those who planned the scenes.There's no recognizable plot; the character just walks straight into the president of some made-up country's house, kills 30 people, and we watch this for 1 hour and 40 minutes. The FBI is portrayed as if it's a village organization; the detectives hang out like it's their dad's farm. It's unbelievable. They wrote a movie without sitting down and thinking about these details; it's astonishing.The Beekeeper program is constantly mentioned in the film, but what is it? What do these people do? How were they trained? What hardships did they endure? None of it is there; they just expect us to believe in a name. There's nothing about how the top-secret deadly agents of the government are trained.Money theft and the presidential race are portrayed like child's play. These are not people you can easily reach; to blow up a building or enter the president's mansion, you need an incredibly good script, and this film has none of that.The acting is also bad, except for Jason Statham. There's no good performance except him. The character's motivation is bad too; killing 100 people because a woman who treated him well while beekeeping shot herself. We should have seen a 3-5 minute segment about their intimacy.I don't know what else to say; it just goes on and on, complete bulls**t. I'm thinking about David Ayer's early works, and nowadays, each film he makes is dragging everything further down. The screenwriter, Kurt Wimmer, has also messed up; he wrote it thoughtlessly. I'm eagerly anticipating the film's complete failure at the box office. Definitely a waste of time.."
"The Beekeeper","UniqueParticle","11 January 2024",NA,"So glad I got to see an early screening in imax on 1-6-24 just couldn't review yet.

The writing is magnificent too Kurt Whimmer is perfect for in depth action extravaganza.For an autistic person that's been scammed numerous times Beekeeper hit the spot; I absolutely loved the way everything played out.

It was unwatchable, I stayed in the cinema because I had my little brother with me, and wouldn't be rude and interfere with the other people in the cinema.This movies gets -3/10Way too cheesy and cringe. David Ayer this is a redo, better luck next time. My sincere condolences for the people watching.Just another movie for the money, so sad."
"The Beekeeper","petercarlsson-92297","30 January 2024",NA,"Jason Statham does the same movie - again - that he's been doing the last 20 years. This time without a script. They just stacked a number of fight and action scenes on top of each other, then called it a movie.Statham has done a few rather good movies like this. For example ""Homefront"". That movie had a script and good acting. But this... What is this? Is it made for teenage boys? For adults? For girls? Boys? I don't know, but the result is nothing new, nothing thrilling and nothing fun.So what do we got. Well, that's a really good question. The problem is that there's very, very hard to find a good answer."
"The Beekeeper","Brillfury","13 January 2024",NA,"Look,I love a good action flick as much as anyone, and Jason Statham is usually awesome. But sadly director David Ayer delivers what will probably be one of the worst movies of 2024. Ayer made one great movie over 20 years ago (Training Day) and also delivered a good flick in Fury, but everything else he makes is horrible. I will admit I did get a kick out of how dumb and goofy this movie is, and laughed a lot. Statham's character is like a cardboard box, it's so boring. Yes his fighting scenes are very cool but he's played awesome characters before that also had a bit of kick. In this movie he gives us nothing.Phylicia Rashad looks fabulous and gets about 5 minutes of screen time. Jeremy Irons and Josh Hutcherson do a great job but their talents are wasted in this movie.The plot starts out really promising...who wouldn't love to see a revenge action movie where the evil call centers get justice? But sadly the premise is wasted.Oh if you love hearing the word ""Beekeeper"" and references to bees you'll love this.The dialogue in this movie is so corny. It's almost like a satire of action movies at some points.In David Ayer's world, nothing works like it actually does in the real world. It is so goofy the way he portrays everything. And this is something he does in a lot of his movies. Just dumb fictional versions of everything from presidents to agencies to how classified programs work. But I do understand they have to make movies and sometimes make everything really stupid to be entertaining. But this movie takes the cake. For instance, call center scams are a real thing and there are many YouTube videos showing how they operate. But in this movie, the call center office is the most over the top clown spectacle you'll ever see and the actual scam is a ludicrous fictionalized version of how they actually work.The two main FBI agents are portrayed goofy AF and their dialogue is nearly unbearable.Statham's character, the beekeeper, doesn't want you to steal from old people but he has no qualms with murdering about 50 federal law enforcement officers in the course of the movie without batting an eye.So if you are about 13 years old this movie will be the coolest thing you've seen but anywhere over that and it's just too dumb. Maybe when it's on streaming it might be fun to watch and make fun of on a rainy day."
"The Beekeeper","TheNamelessCzar","27 January 2024",NA,"This may be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in the theater. I should've known better knowing I was going to see a Jason Statham movie. He has no talent, and he simply is known for his name and his action/fighting skills. But the reviews were so good! Apparently, the reviewers were paid off. The plot is ridiculous, and the acting skills were as bad as a high school drama club,. At times, I felt like I was watching ann episode of NOVA learning all sorts of things about bees. Statham has one facial expression in the movie, and it looks like boredom. Never again will I see on of his movie sin the theater... I'll wait to bore myself at home when it comes on streaming instead."
"The Beekeeper","masonsaul","13 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper isn't as tight or condensed as the films it borrows from thanks to an unexpectedly dense mythology but it really delivers where it counts. It's essentially Jason Statham beating people up for 100 minutes and it never gets old. Thankfully it doesn't really sequel bait however more of these would definitely be welcome.Jason Statham is never bad even when he's in a dud like a few of his recent films. Even so, it's nice to see his talent and physicality employed in something actually good. Jeremy Irons has the ability to deliver exposition about beekeeping in an engaging manner and Josh Hutcherson is actually awake for this one.Similarly to Statham, David Ayer has had a few misses so it's equally rewarding to see him back doing what he knows best whilst showing he and his team are really good at hand to hand combat. The score by David Sardy & Jared Michael Fry is a huge part of why this works, treating the dumbest twists with the utmost seriousness."
"The Beekeeper","masonfisk","30 January 2024",NA,"The first film of the year may rank as one of the worst for the same as Jason Statham kicks butts & takes names (or is it the other way around?) in this goofy revenge tale. Statham, a former government operative, has retired plying his trade running an apiary on a retired woman's property, Phylicia Rashad, but after she commits suicide after being ripped off by some internet sharks prompting Statham to spew bad bee puns while he kills his way to the top (or bottom, these people are scum!) in a concern which runs right to the heights of the White House as the president's, Gemma Redgrave, (from Howard's End) son, played by Josh Hutcherson, is raking in millions from duped customers which will not stand as far as Statham is concerned. David Ayer, a mismatched director for this material (was Shane Black busy?), directs a particularly goofy premise from scenarist David Wimmer, does not help a whit w/humorless Statham doing the physical lifting w/o any issues but the unintentional guffaws generated from villains who look like extras from The Terminator's Tech-noir dance club scene makes this memorable outing for the wrong reasons. Also starring Oscar winner Jeremy Irons as Redgrave's handler, Oscar nominee Minnie Driver (wasted frankly!) as a government contact & Emmy Raver-Lampman (from The Umbrella Academy) who plays Rashad's daughter."
"The Beekeeper","timeblank","21 January 2024",NA,"I fell victim to a scam, and it's satisfying to see scammers getting their due in the Beekeeper movie. Jason Statham's action-packed destruction of the building and culprits is glorious. Despite the absurd plot, the theme of justice prevails. The constant investigation of Statham's crimes is annoying, and the movie's direction raises many questions. The initial 30 minutes were captivating, but the eventual disappointment left me perplexed. Nonetheless, I still enjoyed the movie, even with its absurdities.Beekeeper seems like a John Wick movie - I acknowledge the similarities, but it's purely for entertainment, nothing beyond that!"
"The Beekeeper","slydon13","21 January 2024",NA,"When you see the opening credits - Minnie Driver, Jeremy Irons and Phylicia Rashad - the possiblity exists that this could be worth watching. Ms Driver only had the 2 scenes so she didn't have to be paid as much to surrender her dignity to keep a straight face . Jeremy Irons had to work much harder.The target audience is presumably teenage boys who don't expect or need a script. I presume the 3 actors named above where offered ridiculous money to be part of this enterprise. They are the comprobable film to the Hallmark Christmas movie (with everything pretty much similar to the cookie cutter used for all the previous examples )Presumably they had X number of required explosions , Y in the stunt crew, calculated Z as the number of scenes with a few gaps for words (lets not call it a script)The industry needs these kind of 'Expendeble' wholy forgettable flic to fill in.I only went to see this because I had a free ticket and if I had actually PAID money to see this, I'd likely be angry at my choice or disappointed.There are lots of better old films from the 30s, 40s, 50 etc . This was a waste of time but my autistic nephew loves going to the cinema and I'm part of his 'entertainment team'."

"The Beekeeper","samyakrout-65994","24 January 2024",NA,"The only good part the stealth and fitness of Jason Statham.This movie is so bad that where to start. Ofcourse the story didn't delayed and started immediately with a scam and then Jason went on killing spree.The first few actions were a bit relatable and ok but then the story became from good to bad and then worse when the president of USA showed up and the secret service could not even did the job they always were regarded as highly and that js to secure and save the president. No character building and not much of investigation.Its a one man show and the most irritating were those two FBI agents who for no reason were cracking boring jokes on each other and eve though they had chances but never cared to shoot him.The main villain who is again another immature gen z character who js always high on drugs was easily having drugs within the presidential house and killed the fbi director as if nothing to worry about.Damn boring boring and repetitive. All characters were so boring and irritable in nature.The best scene was the ending when i left my seat."
"The Beekeeper","chenp-54708","12 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper is one of those dumb stupid action movies that are so ridiculously dumb, yet still has some strong parts. Director David Ayer isn't a filmmaker I really like but I have enjoyed a few of his works like Training Day and End of Watch. His previous movie The Tax Collector was absolutely atrocious but The Beekeeper is slightly better than his last movie.Many of the action thrills, stunts, moments and scenes were ridiculous but for the most part, well-executed and shot pretty well. Although with some mix of poor editing and bad uses of CGI. All the performances were okay as Jason Statham still plays himself but still the fun aspect of the movie. The narrative is pretty ridiculous and kind of dumb where the more you think about it, the more dumber it becomes. The style definitely takes a bit too much influence on the John Wick series and some of the dialogue is quite laughable. But hey, all in all, I did enjoy some moments because it clearly doesn't take itself too seriously and the actions, thrills and Statham being himself was pretty fun."
"The Beekeeper","kmkevinn-64733","12 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper buzzes with intensity as it unveils a gripping tale of vengeance that transcends personal vendettas to impact an entire nation. The film takes you on a relentless journey with one man, a former operative of the enigmatic 'Beekeepers.' What begins as a brutal campaign for personal justice quickly escalates into a high-stakes thriller with national consequences. The storytelling is a masterclass maybe mediocre in suspense, weaving a web of intrigue and unveiling layers of a clandestine organization. The protagonist's journey from a solitary avenger to a player in a larger, more dangerous game is both compelling, almost average and chilling. The Beekeeper delivers not only on the promise of riveting action but also explores the shadowy realms of power and conspiracy, making it a must-watch for any fans of gripping thrillers with a touch of espionage intrigue. The 6/10 is appropriate."
"The Beekeeper","DocteurDream","30 January 2024",NA,"Verona Parker is easily one of the worst characters ever written for the screen, takes away everything this movie aspires to be. The actress also did a piss poor job and always had me cringing at the unrealistic and unreasonable choices she makes. If you'd delete that character entirely, this movie would've been a whole lot better in the long run.Subject wise it's a very nice concept of a revenge thriller against scam call centers- but again, the whole govt mumbo jumbo makes it feel a whole run of the mill action BS from Hollywood mid tier movies. If the story had been awhole lot grounded, it would've done a whole lot better imo."
"The Beekeeper","kjproulx","12 January 2024",NA,"By now, audiences should realize what they are in for when it comes to Jason Statham leading an action film. The Beekeeper is the latest film to continue his long-running legacy of action flicks and it's quite a bit of fun. It's very far from an awards nominee, but for a film I had zero expectations for, and for being as cheesy as it is, it's pretty good. Take that as you will because I will be diving into things that are also pretty bad as well. The cheesiness of this film will turn some people off, but I was able to ignore it. Here's why I recommend The Beekeeper if you want to watch a new action-packed film to enjoy and not have to think too much about.The ""Beekeepers"" is an organization of hitmen who take out criminals. Jason Statham plays Adam Clay, a retiree from this organization, who is on a manhunt for everyone involved in scamming a woman he cared for, which led to her suicide. It's as simple as that. There are multiple bosses in this company, so it's like watching a sophisticated video game being played out. The action sequences are well-choreographed and there are quite a few action scenes, so overall, this film was a blast to watch. With that said, the dialogue from beginning to end it pretty atrocious.If the script had been reworked, I think this could've been a surprisingly great film as a whole. Sadly, the dialogue is full of Bee puns that fall flat almost every time, even with solid actors delivering them. The character arc and dialogue for Josh Hutcherson's Derek Danforth (who is the main villain of the film) is laughable, and not really in a good way. His whiny, self-entitled performance was great and I liked that he was giving this character his all, it's just that, again, the dialogue sucks. The lines everyone was saying took me out of the experience many times. Still, there is a lot of great action, and that's what I wanted from a movie like this anyway. I'm sure the dialogue will have people hating this movie and I'm equally sure certain people will find it hilarious. I'm kind of in the middle.The Beekeeper is David Ayer's latest directorial effort and as always, he does a great job with action. His touch as a director is always welcomed by me and the neon look to the film was cool as well. It's a cool film to watch and it's aesthetically pleasing. I may be ripping apart the script, but it's just the dialogue. The story itself plays out nicely and has a nice resolution. I was looking for a fun action film and this film delivered that, despite its downfalls. I say check it out."
"The Beekeeper","FeastMode","12 January 2024",NA,"I seem to use that headline a lot. I guess it's better than a bad movie with bad fight scenes.Starting with the good, Statham is awesome as usual. And I loved all of the fight scenes. They are ridiculously fast yet completely clear. It's hard hitting, you can feel the blows. This is enhanced by the beastly IMAX speakers. And with the R-rating, it doesn't hold back. Although it's far from gratuitous.The bad? Sigh. The non-action scenes, which make up the majority of the movie, range from average to terrible. The quality level feels like a streaming movie, not a theatrical one. I spent much of the runtime uninterested and unengaged.Everything feels off. The dialogue is weird. The acting is questionable. And there are a bunch of dumb things that strain believability. Like the entire bad guy organization. Or a laugh-out-loud idiotic character decision during the climax. A true ""are you kidding me?"" moment.Even the cut to credits felt odd. Like the director just cut in the middle of a shot and said, ""screw it, let's go home.""(1 viewing, early screening UltraScreen 1/6/2024)"
"The Beekeeper","Neptune165","2 February 2024",NA,"Just when you think we have reached the bottom of filmmaking ... there is always something like this flick just to prove you can do a lot worse! It s so bland. The FBI agent was not professional and dressed and sounded dumb, lost mom by suicidal act and that did not play much of a roll after the incident,, the villains sounded stupid, especially the dip shots from the call centers. The story idea was great, Jason was awesome but the rest of the actors failed to bring it home. This movie is a terrible revenge story. The idea that Beekeepers are the most elite, well-trained, best equipped one man army is so over-used. The most unbelievable part is that he is hunted by mercenaries, law enforcement, and other Beekeepers. The acting is terrible, the storyline is worse."
"The Beekeeper","BA_Harrison","12 January 2024",NA,"After Fast X and The Meg 2, I swore I wouldn't waste any more of my time on Jason Statham movies, but the trailer for The Beekeeper looked good, so I thought I would give him one last chance. I just hoped that I wouldn't get stung again.Thankfully, this action flick from director David Ayer is as sweet as honey: it's unpretentious, over-the-top, gloriously violent nonsense that isn't to be taken seriously... the film is all about how many people the star can kill or maim during the 1hr 45minute runtime (the answer: a lot!).Statham plays Adam Clay, a beekeeper in more ways than one: he looks after bee hives on the farm owned by kindly Eloise Parker (Phylicia Rashad), but he's also a retired special operative known as a 'beekeeper', part of a government programme so secret even the FBI doesn't know about it. When Eloise loses all of her savings to scammers and commits suicide, Adam isn't a happy man and goes after those responsible, the trail leading all the way to the President of the United States (Jemma Redgrave).Buildings are blown up, limbs are broken, body parts are severed, people are shot, but Adam barely gets a scratch -- those looking for realism should look elsewhere. There's even a scene where a female beekeeper uses a mini-gun mounted on the back of a truck, and mini-guns always equal fun.At the end of the day, Adam makes the bad guys pay for their crimes, and promptly escapes, presumably to set up some more bee hives (the villains having shot up his earlier ones) and to prepare for the inevitable sequel."
"The Beekeeper","imseeg","12 January 2024",NA,"I was excited to see a new action movie with Jason Statham (one of my favorite ACTION actors) and although his figting scenes are still okay (ish), they weren't exhilirating. But there is something worse...The bad: Jason Statham (although in a leading role) doesnt get much screen time. A lot of the time we ONLY get to see a bunch of bland FBI agents, who arent impressing me in any way with their subpar acting performances.Nor do these FBI agents come across as credible by the way, constantly missing Jason Statham when they have all the time and opportunity to kill him point blank. Quite silly.More bad: the other supporting actors are really bad though, But they (AS WELL) do get a lot of screentime. So annoying.Not any good? Actor Jeremy Irons nails it. He plays the role of a cunning sophisticated bad guy and he is terrific. But what the heck is the distinguished and superb actor Jeremy Irons doing in such a cheap looking action movie? HE is the only redeeming feature of this movie though, besides a few action scenes with Jason Statham.Jason Statham fans beware, this one is quite a dud. Tedious, lame, uneventful."
"The Beekeeper","Xavier_Stone","10 January 2024",NA,"Written by Kurt Wimmer who is known for The Expendables which seems about right. Nearly all action which was ok, yet the story is just trash. If you're a fan of Jason then this one is just another average film with his stunts and fighting.Other than that the movie lacks any seriousness and the law enforcement roles are comical and everyone just comes out looking like keystone cops. It could have been so much better with a decent director and a lot of tweaks in the script.Sadly, not enough going on here to please anything but the Jason fans. 3 stars for action, zero for everything else. Even the ending is a zero. Park your brain before watching, no thinking required."
"The Beekeeper","martinrobertson300482","28 January 2024",NA,"Not sure why i went to see this one as i've not seen most of Jason Stathams movies. And if they're anything like this one i won't be in a rush to revisit them.The movie looked dumb, and it is. Statham is a beekeeper. Both metaphorically and genuinely. Infact the worst part of the film isn't how repetitive and boring the action gets (where Statham is practically untouchable). But the cringey push to make ex-military beekeeper tough guys a thing. You'll definitely get some laughs from how ridiculous it all is. But half the time I couldn't really tell if they were intentional laughs or not.I guess there is enough decent action. Like the farm scene, the middle office attack, and there's a decent brutal fight scene near the end. But even the most promising part of the movie - setting up the great villian for a well deserved ass kicking later. Doesn't pay off. So overall, pretty poor."
"The Beekeeper","banzoozalreviews","12 January 2024",NA,"David Ayer's ""The Beekeeper"" has Jason Statham going full John Wick and full Equalizer. This movie is 90 odd minutes of relentless, unhinged, pure escapist fun, with Statham doing what he does best - taking out bad guys like it's nothing and looking uber cool while doing it. He does that here in spades, in the most brutal and ridiculously entertaining ways. Yes, you need to throw believability aside, but if you are a fan of 80s and 90s action thrillers where it's one man against all, you will love this, just like I did. This movie really was a blast and a half, and then some. A great way to start 2024 movie season. I loved it. Pure escapist entertainment."
"The Beekeeper","kuner-59029","14 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper attempts to copy the John Wick formula to the point of plagiarism.The setup is virtually the same. Statham, playing himself as usual, is retired and extremely dangerous ex-assassin, member of a secret group called ""Beekeepers"". He get pulled out of retirement over a seemingly minor incident, and the conflict escalates.A woman he sells honey to (played by the mom from the Cosby Show) commits suicide after having her savings stolen by a scammer company.He takes revenge for her, but oh no, the company belongs to the president's no-good son (similar to the Russian Mob boss's son in the John Wick original).He fights his way to the top through many neon-lit setpieces until he reaches the final boss. The end.However, unlike John Wick, there is none of the fascinating world building, none of the flair, none of the great music editing, much of the acting is awful, and so the whole thing comes apart at the seams. Tonally, the film never hits the mark. Scenes variate between overacted and ridiculous to boring, slow paced and TV series like. Every time the narrative switches to a female FBI agent, the air is sucked out of the movie, and energy comes to a grinding halt.The use of music is awful. It alternates between Batman knock off cello and contrabass strings, which don't fit at all, to house and electronic in scenes where it doesn't fit either. It worked in John Wick, because it was woven into the story. John Wick was either in a night club, or the music was played on the Assassin's radio station. Here it just comes out of nowhere.There are a few good kills. The car off the drawbridge early on is excellent. The final boss fight was decent, but not over the top enough to be memorable.Overall, this is a poorly made film that you will forget the moment you finish it. It's barely watchable, but I deducted points for plagiarism."

"The Beekeeper","petercarlsson-92297","30 January 2024",NA,"Jason Statham does the same movie - again - that he's been doing the last 20 years. This time without a script. They just stacked a number of fight and action scenes on top of each other, then called it a movie.Statham has done a few rather good movies like this. For example ""Homefront"". That movie had a script and good acting. But this... What is this? Is it made for teenage boys? For adults? For girls? Boys? I don't know, but the result is nothing new, nothing thrilling and nothing fun.So what do we got. Well, that's a really good question. The problem is that there's very, very hard to find a good answer."
"The Beekeeper","Brillfury","13 January 2024",NA,"Look,I love a good action flick as much as anyone, and Jason Statham is usually awesome. But sadly director David Ayer delivers what will probably be one of the worst movies of 2024. Ayer made one great movie over 20 years ago (Training Day) and also delivered a good flick in Fury, but everything else he makes is horrible. I will admit I did get a kick out of how dumb and goofy this movie is, and laughed a lot. Statham's character is like a cardboard box, it's so boring. Yes his fighting scenes are very cool but he's played awesome characters before that also had a bit of kick. In this movie he gives us nothing.Phylicia Rashad looks fabulous and gets about 5 minutes of screen time. Jeremy Irons and Josh Hutcherson do a great job but their talents are wasted in this movie.The plot starts out really promising...who wouldn't love to see a revenge action movie where the evil call centers get justice? But sadly the premise is wasted.Oh if you love hearing the word ""Beekeeper"" and references to bees you'll love this.The dialogue in this movie is so corny. It's almost like a satire of action movies at some points.In David Ayer's world, nothing works like it actually does in the real world. It is so goofy the way he portrays everything. And this is something he does in a lot of his movies. Just dumb fictional versions of everything from presidents to agencies to how classified programs work. But I do understand they have to make movies and sometimes make everything really stupid to be entertaining. But this movie takes the cake. For instance, call center scams are a real thing and there are many YouTube videos showing how they operate. But in this movie, the call center office is the most over the top clown spectacle you'll ever see and the actual scam is a ludicrous fictionalized version of how they actually work.The two main FBI agents are portrayed goofy AF and their dialogue is nearly unbearable.Statham's character, the beekeeper, doesn't want you to steal from old people but he has no qualms with murdering about 50 federal law enforcement officers in the course of the movie without batting an eye.So if you are about 13 years old this movie will be the coolest thing you've seen but anywhere over that and it's just too dumb. Maybe when it's on streaming it might be fun to watch and make fun of on a rainy day."
"The Beekeeper","TheNamelessCzar","27 January 2024",NA,"This may be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in the theater. I should've known better knowing I was going to see a Jason Statham movie. He has no talent, and he simply is known for his name and his action/fighting skills. But the reviews were so good! Apparently, the reviewers were paid off. The plot is ridiculous, and the acting skills were as bad as a high school drama club,. At times, I felt like I was watching ann episode of NOVA learning all sorts of things about bees. Statham has one facial expression in the movie, and it looks like boredom. Never again will I see on of his movie sin the theater... I'll wait to bore myself at home when it comes on streaming instead."
"The Beekeeper","masonsaul","13 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper isn't as tight or condensed as the films it borrows from thanks to an unexpectedly dense mythology but it really delivers where it counts. It's essentially Jason Statham beating people up for 100 minutes and it never gets old. Thankfully it doesn't really sequel bait however more of these would definitely be welcome.Jason Statham is never bad even when he's in a dud like a few of his recent films. Even so, it's nice to see his talent and physicality employed in something actually good. Jeremy Irons has the ability to deliver exposition about beekeeping in an engaging manner and Josh Hutcherson is actually awake for this one.Similarly to Statham, David Ayer has had a few misses so it's equally rewarding to see him back doing what he knows best whilst showing he and his team are really good at hand to hand combat. The score by David Sardy & Jared Michael Fry is a huge part of why this works, treating the dumbest twists with the utmost seriousness."
"The Beekeeper","masonfisk","30 January 2024",NA,"The first film of the year may rank as one of the worst for the same as Jason Statham kicks butts & takes names (or is it the other way around?) in this goofy revenge tale. Statham, a former government operative, has retired plying his trade running an apiary on a retired woman's property, Phylicia Rashad, but after she commits suicide after being ripped off by some internet sharks prompting Statham to spew bad bee puns while he kills his way to the top (or bottom, these people are scum!) in a concern which runs right to the heights of the White House as the president's, Gemma Redgrave, (from Howard's End) son, played by Josh Hutcherson, is raking in millions from duped customers which will not stand as far as Statham is concerned. David Ayer, a mismatched director for this material (was Shane Black busy?), directs a particularly goofy premise from scenarist David Wimmer, does not help a whit w/humorless Statham doing the physical lifting w/o any issues but the unintentional guffaws generated from villains who look like extras from The Terminator's Tech-noir dance club scene makes this memorable outing for the wrong reasons. Also starring Oscar winner Jeremy Irons as Redgrave's handler, Oscar nominee Minnie Driver (wasted frankly!) as a government contact & Emmy Raver-Lampman (from The Umbrella Academy) who plays Rashad's daughter."
"The Beekeeper","timeblank","21 January 2024",NA,"I fell victim to a scam, and it's satisfying to see scammers getting their due in the Beekeeper movie. Jason Statham's action-packed destruction of the building and culprits is glorious. Despite the absurd plot, the theme of justice prevails. The constant investigation of Statham's crimes is annoying, and the movie's direction raises many questions. The initial 30 minutes were captivating, but the eventual disappointment left me perplexed. Nonetheless, I still enjoyed the movie, even with its absurdities.Beekeeper seems like a John Wick movie - I acknowledge the similarities, but it's purely for entertainment, nothing beyond that!"
"The Beekeeper","slydon13","21 January 2024",NA,"When you see the opening credits - Minnie Driver, Jeremy Irons and Phylicia Rashad - the possiblity exists that this could be worth watching. Ms Driver only had the 2 scenes so she didn't have to be paid as much to surrender her dignity to keep a straight face . Jeremy Irons had to work much harder.The target audience is presumably teenage boys who don't expect or need a script. I presume the 3 actors named above where offered ridiculous money to be part of this enterprise. They are the comprobable film to the Hallmark Christmas movie (with everything pretty much similar to the cookie cutter used for all the previous examples )Presumably they had X number of required explosions , Y in the stunt crew, calculated Z as the number of scenes with a few gaps for words (lets not call it a script)The industry needs these kind of 'Expendeble' wholy forgettable flic to fill in.I only went to see this because I had a free ticket and if I had actually PAID money to see this, I'd likely be angry at my choice or disappointed.There are lots of better old films from the 30s, 40s, 50 etc . This was a waste of time but my autistic nephew loves going to the cinema and I'm part of his 'entertainment team'."

"The Beekeeper","samyakrout-65994","24 January 2024",NA,"The only good part the stealth and fitness of Jason Statham.This movie is so bad that where to start. Ofcourse the story didn't delayed and started immediately with a scam and then Jason went on killing spree.The first few actions were a bit relatable and ok but then the story became from good to bad and then worse when the president of USA showed up and the secret service could not even did the job they always were regarded as highly and that js to secure and save the president. No character building and not much of investigation.Its a one man show and the most irritating were those two FBI agents who for no reason were cracking boring jokes on each other and eve though they had chances but never cared to shoot him.The main villain who is again another immature gen z character who js always high on drugs was easily having drugs within the presidential house and killed the fbi director as if nothing to worry about.Damn boring boring and repetitive. All characters were so boring and irritable in nature.The best scene was the ending when i left my seat."
"The Beekeeper","chenp-54708","12 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper is one of those dumb stupid action movies that are so ridiculously dumb, yet still has some strong parts. Director David Ayer isn't a filmmaker I really like but I have enjoyed a few of his works like Training Day and End of Watch. His previous movie The Tax Collector was absolutely atrocious but The Beekeeper is slightly better than his last movie.Many of the action thrills, stunts, moments and scenes were ridiculous but for the most part, well-executed and shot pretty well. Although with some mix of poor editing and bad uses of CGI. All the performances were okay as Jason Statham still plays himself but still the fun aspect of the movie. The narrative is pretty ridiculous and kind of dumb where the more you think about it, the more dumber it becomes. The style definitely takes a bit too much influence on the John Wick series and some of the dialogue is quite laughable. But hey, all in all, I did enjoy some moments because it clearly doesn't take itself too seriously and the actions, thrills and Statham being himself was pretty fun."
"The Beekeeper","kmkevinn-64733","12 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper buzzes with intensity as it unveils a gripping tale of vengeance that transcends personal vendettas to impact an entire nation. The film takes you on a relentless journey with one man, a former operative of the enigmatic 'Beekeepers.' What begins as a brutal campaign for personal justice quickly escalates into a high-stakes thriller with national consequences. The storytelling is a masterclass maybe mediocre in suspense, weaving a web of intrigue and unveiling layers of a clandestine organization. The protagonist's journey from a solitary avenger to a player in a larger, more dangerous game is both compelling, almost average and chilling. The Beekeeper delivers not only on the promise of riveting action but also explores the shadowy realms of power and conspiracy, making it a must-watch for any fans of gripping thrillers with a touch of espionage intrigue. The 6/10 is appropriate."
"The Beekeeper","DocteurDream","30 January 2024",NA,"Verona Parker is easily one of the worst characters ever written for the screen, takes away everything this movie aspires to be. The actress also did a piss poor job and always had me cringing at the unrealistic and unreasonable choices she makes. If you'd delete that character entirely, this movie would've been a whole lot better in the long run.Subject wise it's a very nice concept of a revenge thriller against scam call centers- but again, the whole govt mumbo jumbo makes it feel a whole run of the mill action BS from Hollywood mid tier movies. If the story had been awhole lot grounded, it would've done a whole lot better imo."
"The Beekeeper","kjproulx","12 January 2024",NA,"By now, audiences should realize what they are in for when it comes to Jason Statham leading an action film. The Beekeeper is the latest film to continue his long-running legacy of action flicks and it's quite a bit of fun. It's very far from an awards nominee, but for a film I had zero expectations for, and for being as cheesy as it is, it's pretty good. Take that as you will because I will be diving into things that are also pretty bad as well. The cheesiness of this film will turn some people off, but I was able to ignore it. Here's why I recommend The Beekeeper if you want to watch a new action-packed film to enjoy and not have to think too much about.The ""Beekeepers"" is an organization of hitmen who take out criminals. Jason Statham plays Adam Clay, a retiree from this organization, who is on a manhunt for everyone involved in scamming a woman he cared for, which led to her suicide. It's as simple as that. There are multiple bosses in this company, so it's like watching a sophisticated video game being played out. The action sequences are well-choreographed and there are quite a few action scenes, so overall, this film was a blast to watch. With that said, the dialogue from beginning to end it pretty atrocious.If the script had been reworked, I think this could've been a surprisingly great film as a whole. Sadly, the dialogue is full of Bee puns that fall flat almost every time, even with solid actors delivering them. The character arc and dialogue for Josh Hutcherson's Derek Danforth (who is the main villain of the film) is laughable, and not really in a good way. His whiny, self-entitled performance was great and I liked that he was giving this character his all, it's just that, again, the dialogue sucks. The lines everyone was saying took me out of the experience many times. Still, there is a lot of great action, and that's what I wanted from a movie like this anyway. I'm sure the dialogue will have people hating this movie and I'm equally sure certain people will find it hilarious. I'm kind of in the middle.The Beekeeper is David Ayer's latest directorial effort and as always, he does a great job with action. His touch as a director is always welcomed by me and the neon look to the film was cool as well. It's a cool film to watch and it's aesthetically pleasing. I may be ripping apart the script, but it's just the dialogue. The story itself plays out nicely and has a nice resolution. I was looking for a fun action film and this film delivered that, despite its downfalls. I say check it out."
"The Beekeeper","FeastMode","12 January 2024",NA,"I seem to use that headline a lot. I guess it's better than a bad movie with bad fight scenes.Starting with the good, Statham is awesome as usual. And I loved all of the fight scenes. They are ridiculously fast yet completely clear. It's hard hitting, you can feel the blows. This is enhanced by the beastly IMAX speakers. And with the R-rating, it doesn't hold back. Although it's far from gratuitous.The bad? Sigh. The non-action scenes, which make up the majority of the movie, range from average to terrible. The quality level feels like a streaming movie, not a theatrical one. I spent much of the runtime uninterested and unengaged.Everything feels off. The dialogue is weird. The acting is questionable. And there are a bunch of dumb things that strain believability. Like the entire bad guy organization. Or a laugh-out-loud idiotic character decision during the climax. A true ""are you kidding me?"" moment.Even the cut to credits felt odd. Like the director just cut in the middle of a shot and said, ""screw it, let's go home.""(1 viewing, early screening UltraScreen 1/6/2024)"
"The Beekeeper","Neptune165","2 February 2024",NA,"Just when you think we have reached the bottom of filmmaking ... there is always something like this flick just to prove you can do a lot worse! It s so bland. The FBI agent was not professional and dressed and sounded dumb, lost mom by suicidal act and that did not play much of a roll after the incident,, the villains sounded stupid, especially the dip shots from the call centers. The story idea was great, Jason was awesome but the rest of the actors failed to bring it home. This movie is a terrible revenge story. The idea that Beekeepers are the most elite, well-trained, best equipped one man army is so over-used. The most unbelievable part is that he is hunted by mercenaries, law enforcement, and other Beekeepers. The acting is terrible, the storyline is worse."
"The Beekeeper","BA_Harrison","12 January 2024",NA,"After Fast X and The Meg 2, I swore I wouldn't waste any more of my time on Jason Statham movies, but the trailer for The Beekeeper looked good, so I thought I would give him one last chance. I just hoped that I wouldn't get stung again.Thankfully, this action flick from director David Ayer is as sweet as honey: it's unpretentious, over-the-top, gloriously violent nonsense that isn't to be taken seriously... the film is all about how many people the star can kill or maim during the 1hr 45minute runtime (the answer: a lot!).Statham plays Adam Clay, a beekeeper in more ways than one: he looks after bee hives on the farm owned by kindly Eloise Parker (Phylicia Rashad), but he's also a retired special operative known as a 'beekeeper', part of a government programme so secret even the FBI doesn't know about it. When Eloise loses all of her savings to scammers and commits suicide, Adam isn't a happy man and goes after those responsible, the trail leading all the way to the President of the United States (Jemma Redgrave).Buildings are blown up, limbs are broken, body parts are severed, people are shot, but Adam barely gets a scratch -- those looking for realism should look elsewhere. There's even a scene where a female beekeeper uses a mini-gun mounted on the back of a truck, and mini-guns always equal fun.At the end of the day, Adam makes the bad guys pay for their crimes, and promptly escapes, presumably to set up some more bee hives (the villains having shot up his earlier ones) and to prepare for the inevitable sequel."
"The Beekeeper","imseeg","12 January 2024",NA,"I was excited to see a new action movie with Jason Statham (one of my favorite ACTION actors) and although his figting scenes are still okay (ish), they weren't exhilirating. But there is something worse...The bad: Jason Statham (although in a leading role) doesnt get much screen time. A lot of the time we ONLY get to see a bunch of bland FBI agents, who arent impressing me in any way with their subpar acting performances.Nor do these FBI agents come across as credible by the way, constantly missing Jason Statham when they have all the time and opportunity to kill him point blank. Quite silly.More bad: the other supporting actors are really bad though, But they (AS WELL) do get a lot of screentime. So annoying.Not any good? Actor Jeremy Irons nails it. He plays the role of a cunning sophisticated bad guy and he is terrific. But what the heck is the distinguished and superb actor Jeremy Irons doing in such a cheap looking action movie? HE is the only redeeming feature of this movie though, besides a few action scenes with Jason Statham.Jason Statham fans beware, this one is quite a dud. Tedious, lame, uneventful."
"The Beekeeper","Xavier_Stone","10 January 2024",NA,"Written by Kurt Wimmer who is known for The Expendables which seems about right. Nearly all action which was ok, yet the story is just trash. If you're a fan of Jason then this one is just another average film with his stunts and fighting.Other than that the movie lacks any seriousness and the law enforcement roles are comical and everyone just comes out looking like keystone cops. It could have been so much better with a decent director and a lot of tweaks in the script.Sadly, not enough going on here to please anything but the Jason fans. 3 stars for action, zero for everything else. Even the ending is a zero. Park your brain before watching, no thinking required."
"The Beekeeper","martinrobertson300482","28 January 2024",NA,"Not sure why i went to see this one as i've not seen most of Jason Stathams movies. And if they're anything like this one i won't be in a rush to revisit them.The movie looked dumb, and it is. Statham is a beekeeper. Both metaphorically and genuinely. Infact the worst part of the film isn't how repetitive and boring the action gets (where Statham is practically untouchable). But the cringey push to make ex-military beekeeper tough guys a thing. You'll definitely get some laughs from how ridiculous it all is. But half the time I couldn't really tell if they were intentional laughs or not.I guess there is enough decent action. Like the farm scene, the middle office attack, and there's a decent brutal fight scene near the end. But even the most promising part of the movie - setting up the great villian for a well deserved ass kicking later. Doesn't pay off. So overall, pretty poor."
"The Beekeeper","banzoozalreviews","12 January 2024",NA,"David Ayer's ""The Beekeeper"" has Jason Statham going full John Wick and full Equalizer. This movie is 90 odd minutes of relentless, unhinged, pure escapist fun, with Statham doing what he does best - taking out bad guys like it's nothing and looking uber cool while doing it. He does that here in spades, in the most brutal and ridiculously entertaining ways. Yes, you need to throw believability aside, but if you are a fan of 80s and 90s action thrillers where it's one man against all, you will love this, just like I did. This movie really was a blast and a half, and then some. A great way to start 2024 movie season. I loved it. Pure escapist entertainment."
"The Beekeeper","kuner-59029","14 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper attempts to copy the John Wick formula to the point of plagiarism.The setup is virtually the same. Statham, playing himself as usual, is retired and extremely dangerous ex-assassin, member of a secret group called ""Beekeepers"". He get pulled out of retirement over a seemingly minor incident, and the conflict escalates.A woman he sells honey to (played by the mom from the Cosby Show) commits suicide after having her savings stolen by a scammer company.He takes revenge for her, but oh no, the company belongs to the president's no-good son (similar to the Russian Mob boss's son in the John Wick original).He fights his way to the top through many neon-lit setpieces until he reaches the final boss. The end.However, unlike John Wick, there is none of the fascinating world building, none of the flair, none of the great music editing, much of the acting is awful, and so the whole thing comes apart at the seams. Tonally, the film never hits the mark. Scenes variate between overacted and ridiculous to boring, slow paced and TV series like. Every time the narrative switches to a female FBI agent, the air is sucked out of the movie, and energy comes to a grinding halt.The use of music is awful. It alternates between Batman knock off cello and contrabass strings, which don't fit at all, to house and electronic in scenes where it doesn't fit either. It worked in John Wick, because it was woven into the story. John Wick was either in a night club, or the music was played on the Assassin's radio station. Here it just comes out of nowhere.There are a few good kills. The car off the drawbridge early on is excellent. The final boss fight was decent, but not over the top enough to be memorable.Overall, this is a poorly made film that you will forget the moment you finish it. It's barely watchable, but I deducted points for plagiarism."
"The Beekeeper","sbweightman","12 January 2024",NA,"A really enjoyable revenge action film full of fast paced action and corny bee-related dialogue. Although the character's backstory has been done many times before, the plot has some modern ideas and modern villains which are easy to hate and the strong moral message was quite refreshing. Good acting from a good cast of characters and whilst some of the henchmen are a bit silly, their larger than life presence adds some surprises into what is otherwise pretty standard fare. Good pacing, music and fight scenes keep it entertaining throughout, although the start is pretty slow and the ending rather abrupt."
"The Beekeeper","olcare","10 January 2024",NA,"I mean, I don't know what to say; it feels like the movie's script was randomly written without any thought. The events are so poorly explained that I couldn't believe it while watching. I have no idea how they shot it. I'm addressing everyone who watched and gave good ratings: watch it again, life is not that simple.I want to mention Jason Statham. The only good thing in the movie is Jason. He is more than an actor; he's an excellent athlete, continuing this for years and elevating all the action scenes in every action movie. In some fight scenes in this film, extras stand there taking hits flatly, and it's entirely the fault of those who planned the scenes.There's no recognizable plot; the character just walks straight into the president of some made-up country's house, kills 30 people, and we watch this for 1 hour and 40 minutes. The FBI is portrayed as if it's a village organization; the detectives hang out like it's their dad's farm. It's unbelievable. They wrote a movie without sitting down and thinking about these details; it's astonishing.The Beekeeper program is constantly mentioned in the film, but what is it? What do these people do? How were they trained? What hardships did they endure? None of it is there; they just expect us to believe in a name. There's nothing about how the top-secret deadly agents of the government are trained.Money theft and the presidential race are portrayed like child's play. These are not people you can easily reach; to blow up a building or enter the president's mansion, you need an incredibly good script, and this film has none of that.The acting is also bad, except for Jason Statham. There's no good performance except him. The character's motivation is bad too; killing 100 people because a woman who treated him well while beekeeping shot herself. We should have seen a 3-5 minute segment about their intimacy.I don't know what else to say; it just goes on and on, complete bulls**t. I'm thinking about David Ayer's early works, and nowadays, each film he makes is dragging everything further down. The screenwriter, Kurt Wimmer, has also messed up; he wrote it thoughtlessly. I'm eagerly anticipating the film's complete failure at the box office. Definitely a waste of time.."

I've been a fan of Jason Statham for a couple decades now and this is one of his best.

Thankfully it doesn't really sequel bait however more of these would definitely be welcome.Jason Statham is never bad even when he's in a dud like a few of his recent films. Even so, it's nice to see his talent and physicality employed in something actually good. Jeremy Irons has the ability to deliver exposition about beekeeping in an engaging manner and Josh Hutcherson is actually awake for this one.Similarly to Statham, David Ayer has had a few misses so it's equally rewarding to see him back doing what he knows best whilst showing he and his team are really good at hand to hand combat. The score by David Sardy & Jared Michael Fry is a huge part of why this works, treating the dumbest twists with the utmost seriousness."
"The Beekeeper","masonfisk","30 January 2024",NA,"The first film of the year may rank as one of the worst for the same as Jason Statham kicks butts & takes names (or is it the other way around?) in this goofy revenge tale. Statham, a former government operative, has retired plying his trade running an apiary on a retired woman's property, Phylicia Rashad, but after she commits suicide after being ripped off by some internet sharks prompting Statham to spew bad bee puns while he kills his way to the top (or bottom, these people are scum!) in a concern which runs right to the heights of the White House as the president's, Gemma Redgrave, (from Howard's End) son, played by Josh Hutcherson, is raking in millions from duped customers which will not stand as far as Statham is concerned. David Ayer, a mismatched director for this material (was Shane Black busy?), directs a particularly goofy premise from scenarist David Wimmer, does not help a whit w/humorless Statham doing the physical lifting w/o any issues but the unintentional guffaws generated from villains who look like extras from The Terminator's Tech-noir dance club scene makes this memorable outing for the wrong reasons. Also starring Oscar winner Jeremy Irons as Redgrave's handler, Oscar nominee Minnie Driver (wasted frankly!) as a government contact & Emmy Raver-Lampman (from The Umbrella Academy) who plays Rashad's daughter."
"The Beekeeper","timeblank","21 January 2024",NA,"I fell victim to a scam, and it's satisfying to see scammers getting their due in the Beekeeper movie. Jason Statham's action-packed destruction of the building and culprits is glorious. Despite the absurd plot, the theme of justice prevails. The constant investigation of Statham's crimes is annoying, and the movie's direction raises many questions. The initial 30 minutes were captivating, but the eventual disappointment left me perplexed. Nonetheless, I still enjoyed the movie, even with its absurdities.Beekeeper seems like a John Wick movie - I acknowledge the similarities, but it's purely for entertainment, nothing beyond that!"
"The Beekeeper","slydon13","21 January 2024",NA,"When you see the opening credits - Minnie Driver, Jeremy Irons and Phylicia Rashad - the possiblity exists that this could be worth watching. Ms Driver only had the 2 scenes so she didn't have to be paid as much to surrender her dignity to keep a straight face . Jeremy Irons had to work much harder.The target audience is presumably teenage boys who don't expect or need a script. I presume the 3 actors named above where offered ridiculous money to be part of this enterprise. They are the comprobable film to the Hallmark Christmas movie (with everything pretty much similar to the cookie cutter used for all the previous examples )Presumably they had X number of required explosions , Y in the stunt crew, calculated Z as the number of scenes with a few gaps for words (lets not call it a script)The industry needs these kind of 'Expendeble' wholy forgettable flic to fill in.I only went to see this because I had a free ticket and if I had actually PAID money to see this, I'd likely be angry at my choice or disappointed.There are lots of better old films from the 30s, 40s, 50 etc . This was a waste of time but my autistic nephew loves going to the cinema and I'm part of his 'entertainment team'."

"The Beekeeper","samyakrout-65994","24 January 2024",NA,"The only good part the stealth and fitness of Jason Statham.This movie is so bad that where to start. Ofcourse the story didn't delayed and started immediately with a scam and then Jason went on killing spree.The first few actions were a bit relatable and ok but then the story became from good to bad and then worse when the president of USA showed up and the secret service could not even did the job they always were regarded as highly and that js to secure and save the president. No character building and not much of investigation.Its a one man show and the most irritating were those two FBI agents who for no reason were cracking boring jokes on each other and eve though they had chances but never cared to shoot him.The main villain who is again another immature gen z character who js always high on drugs was easily having drugs within the presidential house and killed the fbi director as if nothing to worry about.Damn boring boring and repetitive. All characters were so boring and irritable in nature.The best scene was the ending when i left my seat."
"The Beekeeper","chenp-54708","12 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper is one of those dumb stupid action movies that are so ridiculously dumb, yet still has some strong parts. Director David Ayer isn't a filmmaker I really like but I have enjoyed a few of his works like Training Day and End of Watch. His previous movie The Tax Collector was absolutely atrocious but The Beekeeper is slightly better than his last movie.Many of the action thrills, stunts, moments and scenes were ridiculous but for the most part, well-executed and shot pretty well. Although with some mix of poor editing and bad uses of CGI. All the performances were okay as Jason Statham still plays himself but still the fun aspect of the movie. The narrative is pretty ridiculous and kind of dumb where the more you think about it, the more dumber it becomes. The style definitely takes a bit too much influence on the John Wick series and some of the dialogue is quite laughable. But hey, all in all, I did enjoy some moments because it clearly doesn't take itself too seriously and the actions, thrills and Statham being himself was pretty fun."
"The Beekeeper","kmkevinn-64733","12 January 2024",NA,"The Beekeeper buzzes with intensity as it unveils a gripping tale of vengeance that transcends personal vendettas to impact an entire nation. The film takes you on a relentless journey with one man, a former operative of the enigmatic 'Beekeepers.' What begins as a brutal campaign for personal justice quickly escalates into a high-stakes thriller with national consequences. The storytelling is a masterclass maybe mediocre in suspense, weaving a web of intrigue and unveiling layers of a clandestine organization. The protagonist's journey from a solitary avenger to a player in a larger, more dangerous game is both compelling, almost average and chilling. The Beekeeper delivers not only on the promise of riveting action but also explores the shadowy realms of power and conspiracy, making it a must-watch for any fans of gripping thrillers with a touch of espionage intrigue. The 6/10 is appropriate."
