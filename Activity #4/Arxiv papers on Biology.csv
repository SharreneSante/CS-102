"2","Online Multi-spectral Neuron Tracing","Bin Duan, Yuzhang Shang, Dawen Cai, Yan Yan","Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC)","In this paper, we propose an online multi-spectral neuron tracing method with uniquely designed modules, where no offline training are required. Our method is trained online to update our enhanced discriminative correlation filter to conglutinate the tracing process. This distinctive offline-training-free schema differentiates us from other training-dependent tracing approaches like deep learning methods since no annotation is needed for our method. Besides, compared to other tracing methods requiring complicated set-up such as for clustering and graph multi-cut, our approach is much easier to be applied to new images. In fact, it only needs a starting bounding box of the tracing neuron, significantly reducing users' configuration effort. Our extensive experiments show that our training-free and easy-configured methodology allows fast and accurate neuron reconstructions in multi-spectral images.","Sun, 10 Mar 2024 16:34:21 UTC (23,690 KB)"
"3","Cracking the neural code for word recognition in convolutional neural networks","Aakash Agrawal, Stanislas Dehaene","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)","Learning to read places a strong challenge on the visual system. Years of expertise lead to a remarkable capacity to separate highly similar letters and encode their relative positions, thus distinguishing words such as FORM and FROM, invariantly over a large range of sizes and absolute positions. How neural circuits achieve invariant word recognition remains unknown. Here, we address this issue by training deep neural network models to recognize written words and then analyzing how reading-specialized units emerge and operate across different layers of the network. With literacy, a small subset of units becomes specialized for word recognition in the learned script, similar to the ""visual word form area"" of the human brain. We show that these units are sensitive to specific letter identities and their distance from the blank space at the left or right of a word, thus acting as ""space bigrams"". These units specifically encode ordinal positions and operate by pooling across low and high-frequency detector units from early layers of the network. The proposed neural code provides a mechanistic insight into how information on letter identity and position is extracted and allow for invariant word recognition, and leads to predictions for reading behavior, error patterns, and the neurophysiology of reading.","Sun, 10 Mar 2024 10:12:32 UTC (2,213 KB)"

"7","Confirmation of the centrality of the Huanan market among early COVID-19 cases","Florence Débarre, Michael Worobey","Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)","The centrality of Wuhan's Huanan market in maps of December 2019 COVID-19 case residential locations, established by Worobey et al. (2022a), has recently been challenged by Stoyan and Chiu (2024, SC2024). SC2024 proposed a statistical test based on the premise that the measure of central tendency (hereafter, ""centre"") of a sample of case locations must coincide with the exact point from which local transmission began. Here we show that this premise is erroneous. SC2024 put forward two alternative centres (centroid and mode) to the centre-point which was used by Worobey et al. for some analyses, and proposed a bootstrapping method, based on their premise, to test whether a particular location is consistent with it being the point source of transmission. We show that SC2024's concerns about the use of centre-points are inconsequential, and that use of centroids for these data is inadvisable. The mode is an appropriate, even optimal, choice as centre; however, contrary to SC2024's results, we demonstrate that with proper implementation of their methods, the mode falls at the entrance of a parking lot at the market itself, and the 95% confidence region around the mode includes the market. Thus, the market cannot be rejected as central even by SC2024's overly stringent statistical test. Our results directly contradict SC2024's and -- together with myriad additional lines of evidence overlooked by SC2024, including crucial epidemiological information -- point to the Huanan market as the early epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sat, 9 Mar 2024 10:16:51 UTC (28,243 KB)"

Yang","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Motivation: The diagnosis and monitoring of Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) are crucial for cancer patients, but the current models (such as P-NET) have limitations in terms of parameter count, generalization, and cost. Results: To address the above issues, we develop a more accurate and efficient Prostate Cancer patient condition prediction model, named PR-NET. By compressing and optimizing the network structure of P-NET, the model complexity is reduced while maintaining high accuracy and interpretability. The PR-NET demonstrated superior performance in predicting prostate cancer patient outcomes, outshining P-NET and six other traditional models with a significant margin. In our rigorous evaluation, PR-NET not only achieved impressive average AUC and Recall scores of 0.94 and 0.83, respectively, on known data but also maintained robust generalizability on five unknown datasets with a higher average AUC of 0.73 and Recall of 0.72, compared to P-NET's 0.68 and 0.5. PR-NET's efficiency was evidenced by its shorter average training and inference times, and its gene-level analysis revealed 46 key genes, demonstrating its enhanced predictive power and efficiency in identifying critical biomarkers for prostate cancer.

In this paper, by combining steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) interactive interface, brain instructions generation module and vehicle lateral control module, a probabilistic output model based on support vector machine (SVM) is proposed for BCV lateral control to improve the driving performance. Firstly, a filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP) algorithm is introduced into the brain instructions generation module, which can improve the off-line decoding performance. Secondly, a sigmod-fitting SVM (SF-SVM) is trained based on the sigmod-fitting method and the lateral control module is developed, which can produce all commands in the form of probability instead of specific single command. Finally, a pre-experiment and two road-keeping experiments are conducted. In the pre-experiment, the experiment results show that, the average highest off-line accuracy among subjects is 95.64\%, while for those in the online stage, the average accuracy is only 84.44\%.

"10","Kinetic theories of state- and generation-dependent cell populations","Mingtao Xia, Tom Chou","Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)","We formulate a general, high-dimensional kinetic theory describing the internal state (such as gene expression or protein levels) of cells in a stochastically evolving population. The resolution of our kinetic theory also allows one to track subpopulations associated with each generation. Both intrinsic noise of the cell's internal attribute and randomness in a cell's division times (demographic stochasticity) are fundamental to the development of our model. Based on this general framework, we are able to marginalize the high-dimensional kinetic PDEs in a number of different ways to derive equations that describe the dynamics of marginalized or ""macroscopic"" quantities such as structured population densities, moments of generation-dependent cellular states, and moments of the total population. We also show how nonlinear ""interaction"" terms in lower-dimensional integrodifferential equations can arise from high-dimensional linear kinetic models that contain rate parameters of a cell (birth and death rates) that depend on variables associated with other cells, generating couplings in the dynamics. Our analysis provides a general, more complete mathematical framework that resolves the coevolution of cell populations and cell states. The approach may be tailored for studying, e.g., gene expression in developing tissues, or other more general particle systems which exhibit Brownian noise in individual attributes and population-level demographic noise.","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 21:59:00 UTC (527 KB)"

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely adopted choice for designing BCI systems due to its non-invasive and cost-effective nature and excellent temporal resolution. Still, it comes at the expense of limited training data, poor signal-to-noise, and a large variability across and within-subject recordings. Finally, setting up a BCI system with many electrodes takes a long time, hindering the widespread adoption of reliable DL architectures in BCIs outside research laboratories. To improve adoption, we need to improve user comfort using, for instance, reliable algorithms that operate with few electrodes. \textbf{Approach:} Our research aims to develop a DL algorithm that delivers effective results with a limited number of electrodes. Taking advantage of the Augmented Covariance Method with SPDNet, we propose the SPDNet$_{\psi}$ architecture and analyze its performance and computational impact, as well as the interpretability of the results. The evaluation is conducted on 5-fold cross-validation, using only three electrodes positioned above the Motor Cortex. The methodology was tested on nearly 100 subjects from several open-source datasets using the Mother Of All BCI Benchmark (MOABB) framework. \textbf{Main results:} The results of our SPDNet$_{\psi}$ demonstrate that the augmented approach combined with the SPDNet significantly outperforms all the current state-of-the-art DL architecture in MI decoding. \textbf{Significance:} This new architecture is explainable, with a low number of trainable parameters and a reduced carbon footprint.","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 19:36:20 UTC (1,906 KB)"
"12","A Feature-based Generalizable Prediction Model for Both Perceptual and Abstract Reasoning","Quan Do, Thomas M. Morin, Chantal E. Stern, Michael E. Hasselmo","Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)","A hallmark of human intelligence is the ability to infer abstract rules from limited experience and apply these rules to unfamiliar situations. This capacity is widely studied in the visual domain using the Raven's Progressive Matrices. Recent advances in deep learning have led to multiple artificial neural network models matching or even surpassing human performance. However, while humans can identify and express the rule underlying these tasks with little to no exposure, contemporary neural networks often rely on massive pattern-based training and cannot express or extrapolate the rule inferred from the task. Furthermore, most Raven's Progressive Matrices or Raven-like tasks used for neural network training used symbolic representations, whereas humans can flexibly switch between symbolic and continuous perceptual representations. In this work, we present an algorithmic approach to rule detection and application using feature detection, affine transformation estimation and search. We applied our model to a simplified Raven's Progressive Matrices task, previously designed for behavioral testing and neuroimaging in humans. The model exhibited one-shot learning and achieved near human-level performance in the symbolic reasoning condition of the simplified task. Furthermore, the model can express the relationships discovered and generate multi-step predictions in accordance with the underlying rule. Finally, the model can reason using continuous patterns. We discuss our results and their relevance to studying abstract reasoning in humans, as well as their implications for improving intelligent machines.","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 19:26:30 UTC (1,147 KB)"

This leads to pseudo-first-order kinetics, simplifying mathematical calculations and experimental analysis. Our proof utilizes a monotonicity property of the system and Kamke's comparison theorem. This linear approximation yields a closed-form solution, enabling accurate modeling and estimation of reaction rate constants even without timescale separation. Building on prior work, we establish that the sufficient condition for the validity of this approximation is $s_0 \ll K$, where $K=k_2/k_1$ is the Van Slyke-Cullen constant. This condition is independent of the initial enzyme concentration. Further, we investigate timescale separation within the linear system, identifying necessary and sufficient conditions and deriving the corresponding reduced one-dimensional equations.","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 18:27:54 UTC (43 KB)"

We then shift our focus by analyzing these same models in ""high-dimensions"" (i.e. in the limit where the number of species and resources in the ecosystem becomes large) and discuss how such complex ecosystems can be analyzed using methods from the statistical physics of disordered systems such as the cavity method and Random Matrix Theory.","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 18:13:06 UTC (15,770 KB)"

Telenomus podisi adults (F0 generation), when exposed to insecticides based on acephate, spinosad and thiamethoxam + lambda-cyhalothrin, showed accumulated mortality of 100% at all temperature levels tested. On the other hand, methoxyfenozide + spinetoram caused average mortalities of 88.75% at 15 °C and 38.75% at 25 and 30 °C. In contrast, the mortality rates caused by chlorfenapyr at 15, 25 and 30 °C were 1.25, 71.25 and 71.25%. On the other hand, surviving adults in lethal toxicity bioassay did not show differences in egg parasitism (F0 generation) and emergence of F1 generation in all temperature levels studied; however, the insecticide methoxyfenozide + spinetoram showed the lowest level of parasitism and emergence of T. podisi. In addition, our results demonstrated significant changes in the proportion of emerged males and females as the temperature increased; however, we did not find any differences when comparing the insecticides studied. Furthermore, we detected a significant interaction between insecticides and temperatures by contaminating the host's parasitized eggs (parasitoid pupal stage). Generally, the highest emergence reduction values were found at the highest temperature studied (30 °C).

Weber","Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)","Phase-separated liquid condensates can spatially organize and thereby regulate chemical processes. However, the physicochemical mechanisms underlying such regulation remain elusive as the intramolecular interactions responsible for phase separation give rise to a coupling between diffusion and chemical reactions at non-dilute conditions. Here, we derive a theoretical framework that decouples the phase separation of scaffold molecules from the reaction kinetics of diluted clients. As a result, phase volume and client partitioning coefficients become control parameters, which enables us to dissect the impact of phase-separated condensates on chemical reactions. We apply this framework to two chemical processes and show how condensates affect the yield of reversible chemical reactions and the initial rate of a simple assembly process. In both cases, we find an optimal condensate volume at which the respective chemical reaction property is maximal.

In contrast, image generation methods can work well on very small datasets, and can find mappings between unpaired datasets, meaning an effectively unlimited amount of paired synthetic data can be generated.

Notably, LLMs struggle with structured data, such as graphs, and often falter when tasked with answering domain-specific questions requiring deep expertise, such as those in biology and chemistry. In this paper, we explore a fundamental question: Can LLMs effectively handle molecule prediction tasks? Rather than pursuing top-tier performance, our goal is to assess how LLMs can contribute to diverse molecule tasks. We identify several classification and regression prediction tasks across six standard molecule datasets. Subsequently, we carefully design a set of prompts to query LLMs on these tasks and compare their performance with existing Machine Learning (ML) models, which include text-based models and those specifically designed for analysing the geometric structure of molecules. Our investigation reveals several key insights: Firstly, LLMs generally lag behind ML models in achieving competitive performance on molecule tasks, particularly when compared to models adept at capturing the geometric structure of molecules, highlighting the constrained ability of LLMs to comprehend graph data. Secondly, LLMs show promise in enhancing the performance of ML models when used collaboratively.

Kornyshev","Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)","In solution, DNA is a highly charged macromolecule which bears a unit of negative charge on each phosphate of its sugar-phosphate backbone. Although partially compensated by counterions adsorbed at or condensed near it, DNA still produces a substantial electric field in its vicinity, which is screened by buffer electrolyte at longer distances from the DNA. Such field has been explored so far predominantly within the scope of a primitive model of the electrolytic solution, not considering more complicated structural effects of the water solvent. In this paper we investigate the distribution of electric field around DNA using linear response nonlocal electrostatic theory, applied here for helix-specific charge distributions, and compare the predictions of such theory with specially performed fully atomistic large scale molecular dynamics simulations. The main finding of this study is that oscillations in the electrostatic potential distribution are present around DNA, caused by the overscreening effect of structured water. Surprisingly, electrolyte ions at physiological concentrations do not strongly disrupt these oscillations, and rather distribute according to these oscillating patterns, indicating that water structural effects dominate the short-range electrostatics. We also show that (i) structured water adsorbed in the grooves of DNA lead to a positive electrostatic potential core, (ii) the Debye length some 10 Å away from the DNA is reduced, effectively renormalised by the helical pitch of the DNA, and (iii) Lorentzian contributions to the nonlocal dielectric function of water, effectively reducing the dielectric constant close to the DNA, enhances the overall electric field. The impressive agreement between the atomistic simulations and the developed theory substantiates the use of nonlocal electrostatics when considering solvent effects in molecular processes in biology.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 23:35:25 UTC (36,557 KB)"

Although deep neural network models have revolutionized the field of image generation with methods such as image style transfer, available methods for video generation are scarce. Here, we introduce the Spatiotemporal Style Transfer (STST) algorithm, a dynamic visual stimulus generation framework that allows powerful manipulation and synthesis of video stimuli for vision research. It is based on a two-stream deep neural network model that factorizes spatial and temporal features to generate dynamic visual stimuli whose model layer activations are matched to those of input videos. As an example, we show that our algorithm enables the generation of model metamers, dynamic stimuli whose layer activations within our two-stream model are matched to those of natural videos. We show that these generated stimuli match the low-level spatiotemporal features of their natural counterparts but lack their high-level semantic features, making it a powerful paradigm to study object recognition. Late layer activations in deep vision models exhibited a lower similarity between natural and metameric stimuli compared to early layers, confirming the lack of high-level information in the generated stimuli.

"26","Cell reprogramming design by transfer learning of functional transcriptional networks","Thomas P. Wytock, Adilson E. Motter","Molecular Networks (q-bio.MN)","Recent developments in synthetic biology, next-generation sequencing, and machine learning provide an unprecedented opportunity to rationally design new disease treatments based on measured responses to gene perturbations and drugs to reprogram cells. The main challenges to seizing this opportunity are the incomplete knowledge of the cellular network and the combinatorial explosion of possible interventions, both of which are insurmountable by experiments. To address these challenges, we develop a transfer learning approach to control cell behavior that is pre-trained on transcriptomic data associated with human cell fates, thereby generating a model of the network dynamics that can be transferred to specific reprogramming goals. The approach combines transcriptional responses to gene perturbations to minimize the difference between a given pair of initial and target transcriptional states. We demonstrate our approach's versatility by applying it to a microarray dataset comprising >9,000 microarrays across 54 cell types and 227 unique perturbations, and an RNASeq dataset consisting of >10,000 sequencing runs across 36 cell types and 138 perturbations. Our approach reproduces known reprogramming protocols with an AUROC of 0.91 while innovating over existing methods by pre-training an adaptable model that can be tailored to specific reprogramming transitions. We show that the number of gene perturbations required to steer from one fate to another increases with decreasing developmental relatedness and that fewer genes are needed to progress along developmental paths than to regress. These findings establish a proof-of-concept for our approach to computationally design control strategies and provide insights into how gene regulatory networks govern phenotype.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 19:00:02 UTC (9,998 KB)"

Nucleic acid and serology-based methods of detection and, immunochromatographic assays are commonly used but these laboratory tests are laborious, expensive and might be subjected to cross-reaction and contamination. Modern optical spectroscopic techniques offer a promising alternative as they are label-free, sensitive, rapid, non-destructive, and demonstrate the potential for incorporation into an autonomous system for disease detection in citrus orchards. Nevertheless, the majority of optical spectroscopic methods for citrus disease detection are still in the trial phases and, require additional efforts to be established as efficient and commercially viable methods. The review presents an overview of fundamental working principles, the state of the art, and explains the applications and limitations of the optical spectroscopy technique including the spectroscopic imaging approach (hyperspectral imaging) in the identification of diseases in citrus plants. The review highlights (1) the technical specifications of optical spectroscopic tools that can potentially be utilized in field measurements, (2) their applications in screening citrus diseases through leaf spectroscopy, and (3) discusses their benefits and limitations, including future insights into label-free identification of citrus diseases. Moreover, the role of artificial intelligence is reviewed as potential effective tools for spectral analysis, enabling more accurate detection of infected citrus leaves even before the appearance of visual symptoms by leveraging compositional, morphological, and chemometric characteristics of the plant leaves. The review aims to encourage stakeholders to enhance the development and commercialization of field-based, label-free optical tools for the rapid and early-stage screening of citrus diseases in plants.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 14:00:39 UTC (1,258 KB)"

This measurement is instrumental in exploring the neural mechanisms underlying tactile perception. On the other hand, tactile acuity can be modulated by global stimulation. Prior research indicates that experimental inflammation induced by an application of capsaicin cream increases2PDT. In our study, we applied chemicals(oregano, menthol, and Sichuan pepper) to selectively activate receptors that usually respond to mild physical stimuli to investigate their influence on2PDT without inducing inflammation. The results unveiled a pronounced augmentation of2PDT following any form of global stimulation. Intriguingly, the cumulative effect of the chemical mix on2PDT appeared to be additive. These observations suggest that Wide Dynamic Range(WDR) neurons, functioning as relay nuclei with projections for touch, warmth, and cold sensations, play a pivotal role in this process. In lateral connection structures parallel to afferent nerve transmission pathways with WDR neurons as relay nuclei, global stimulation amplifies excitatory connections over inhibitory ones, thereby elevating the two-point discrimination threshold.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 11:47:00 UTC (936 KB)"

However, despite the high accuracy achieved in predicting single-chain structures, a significant number of large homo-oligomeric assemblies exhibit internal symmetry, posing a major challenge in structure determination. The performances of existing deep learning methods are limited since the symmetrical protein assembly usually has a long sequence, making structural computation infeasible. In addition, multiple identical subunits in symmetrical protein complex cause the issue of supervision ambiguity in label assignment, requiring a consistent structure modeling for the training. To tackle these problems, we propose a protein folding framework called SGNet to model protein-protein interactions in symmetrical assemblies. SGNet conducts feature extraction on a single subunit and generates the whole assembly using our proposed symmetry module, which largely mitigates computational problems caused by sequence length. Thanks to the elaborate design of modeling symmetry consistently, we can model all global symmetry types in quaternary protein structure prediction. Extensive experimental results on a benchmark of symmetrical protein complexes further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 10:39:48 UTC (6,369 KB)"

Monte Carlo track structure simulations were performed to determine (a) the fluence of incident photons and electrons in water around a gold NP under charged particle equilibrium conditions and (b) the density of ionization clusters produced on average as well as conditional on the occurrence of at least one interaction in the nanoparticle using Associated Volume Clustering. Absorbed dose was determined for comparison with a recent benchmark intercomparison. Reported quantities are normalized to primary fluence, allowing to establish a connection to macroscopic dosimetric quantities. The modification of the electron fluence spectrum by the gold NP is minor and mainly occurs at low energies. The net fluence of electrons emitted from the NP is dominated by electrons resulting from photon interactions. Smaller NPs cause noticeable peaks in the conditional frequency of clusters at distances around 50 nm to 100 nm from the NP surface. The number of clusters per energy imparted is increased at distances of up to 150 nm, and accordingly the enhancement in clustering notably surpasses that of dose enhancement. This work highlights the necessity of nanodosimetric analysis and suggests increased ionization clustering near the nanoparticles due to the emission of low energy Auger electrons. Whereas the electron component of the radiation field plays an important role in determining the background contribution to ionization clustering and energy imparted, the dosimetric effects of nanoparticles are governed by the interplay of secondary electron production by photon interaction (including low energy Auger electrons) and their ability to leave the nanoparticle.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 10:04:44 UTC (10,217 KB)"

Although ML is undeniably useful for identifying patterns in large, complex data sets, its widespread application in biological sciences represents a significant deviation from traditional methods of scientific inquiry. As such, the interplay between these models and scientific understanding in biology is a topic with important implications for the future of scientific research, yet it is a subject that has received little attention. Here, we draw from an epistemological toolkit to contextualize recent applications of ML in biological sciences under modern philosophical theories of understanding, identifying general principles that can guide the design and application of ML systems to model biological phenomena and advance scientific knowledge. We propose that conceptions of scientific understanding as information compression, qualitative intelligibility, and dependency relation modelling provide a useful framework for interpreting ML-mediated understanding of biological systems. Through a detailed analysis of two key application areas of ML in modern biological research - protein structure prediction and single cell RNA-sequencing - we explore how these features have thus far enabled ML systems to advance scientific understanding of their target phenomena, how they may guide the development of future ML models, and the key obstacles that remain in preventing ML from achieving its potential as a tool for biological discovery. Consideration of the epistemological features of ML applications in biology will improve the prospects of these methods to solve important problems and advance scientific understanding of living systems.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 23:20:34 UTC (1,634 KB)"

Additionally, these systems often have spatial variation in the diffusion coefficient which must be determined, such as for injectable drug-eluting implants into heterogeneous tissues. Unfortunately, obtaining the diffusion coefficient from images in such cases is an inverse problem with only discrete data points. The development of a robust method that can work with such noisy and ill-posed datasets to accurately determine spatially-varying diffusion coefficients is of great value across a large range of disciplines. Here, we developed an inverse solver that uses physics informed neural networks (PINNs) to calculate spatially-varying diffusion coefficients from numerical and experimental image data in varying biological and engineering applications. The residual of the transient diffusion equation for a concentration field is minimized to find the diffusion coefficient. The robustness of the method as an inverse solver was tested using both numerical and experimental datasets. The predictions show good agreement with both the numerical and experimental benchmarks; an error of less than 6.31% was obtained against all numerical benchmarks, while the diffusion coefficient calculated in experimental datasets matches the appropriate ranges of other reported literature values. Our work demonstrates the potential of using PINNs to resolve spatially-varying diffusion coefficients, which may aid a wide-range of applications, such as enabling better-designed drug-eluting implants for regenerative medicine or oncology fields.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 18:15:47 UTC (1,494 KB)"

Identifying which alterations have a system-wide impact is a challenging task. Nevertheless, this is an essential first step for prioritizing potential biomarkers. We developed CIBRA (Computational Identification of Biologically Relevant Alterations), a method that determines the system-wide impact of genomic alterations on tumor biology by integrating two distinct omics data types: one indicating genomic alterations (e.g., genomics), and another defining a system-wide expression response (e.g., transcriptomics). CIBRA was evaluated with genome-wide screens in 33 cancer types using primary and metastatic cancer data from the Cancer Genome Atlas and Hartwig Medical Foundation. Results: We demonstrate the capability of CIBRA by successfully confirming the impact of point mutations in experimentally validated oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Surprisingly, many genes affected by structural variants were identified to have a strong system-wide impact (30.3%), suggesting that their role in cancer development has thus far been largely underreported. Additionally, CIBRA can identify impact with only ten cases and controls, providing a novel way to prioritize genomic alterations with a prominent role in cancer biology. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that CIBRA can identify cancer drivers by combining genomics and transcriptomics data. Moreover, our work shows an unexpected substantial system-wide impact of structural variants in cancer.

The proposed FingerNet could extract spatial and temporal features from EEG signals, improving classification accuracy within the same hand. The experimental results demonstrated that performance showed significantly higher accuracy in classifying five finger-tapping tasks, encompassing thumb, index, middle, ring, and little finger movements. FingerNet demonstrated dominant performance compared to the conventional baseline models, EEGNet and DeepConvNet. The average accuracy for FingerNet was 0.3049, whereas EEGNet and DeepConvNet exhibited lower accuracies of 0.2196 and 0.2533, respectively. Statistical validation also demonstrates the predominance of FingerNet over baseline networks. For biased predictions, particularly for thumb and index classes, we led to the implementation of weighted cross-entropy and also adapted the weighted cross-entropy, a method conventionally employed to mitigate class imbalance. The proposed FingerNet involves optimizing network structure, improving performance, and exploring applications beyond fine MI.

When such entities, considered here as particles, tend to assume a coherent state beginning from an incoherent (random) state, what is the time interval for the transition? Also, how do model parameters affect this transition time interval? Given the observations of particle migration over a given time period as a point cloud data sampled at discrete time points, we use Topological Data Analysis, specifically persistent homology, to infer the transition time interval in which the particles undergo regime change. The topology of the particle configuration at any given time instance is captured by the persistent homology specifically Persistence Landscapes. We localize (in time) when such a transition happens by conducting the statistical significance tests namely functional hypothesis tests on persistent homology outputs corresponding to subsets of the time evolution. This process is validated on a known collective behavior model of the self-propelled particles with the regime transitions triggered by changing the model parameters in time. As an application, the developed technique was ultimately used to describe the transition in cellular movement from a disordered state to collective motion when the environment was altered.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 03:19:48 UTC (5,061 KB)"

However, the challenge of designing molecular drugs or materials that incorporate multi-modality prior knowledge remains a critical and complex undertaking. Specifically, achieving a practical molecular design necessitates not only meeting the diversity requirements but also addressing structural and textural constraints with various symmetries outlined by domain experts. In this article, we present an innovative approach to tackle this inverse design problem by formulating it as a multi-modality guidance generation/optimization task. Our proposed solution involves a textural-structure alignment symmetric diffusion framework for the implementation of molecular generation/optimization tasks, namely 3DToMolo. 3DToMolo aims to harmonize diverse modalities, aligning them seamlessly to produce molecular structures adhere to specified symmetric structural and textural constraints by experts in the field. Experimental trials across three guidance generation settings have shown a superior hit generation performance compared to state-of-the-art methodologies. Moreover, 3DToMolo demonstrates the capability to generate novel molecules, incorporating specified target substructures, without the need for prior knowledge. This work not only holds general significance for the advancement of deep learning methodologies but also paves the way for a transformative shift in molecular design strategies. 3DToMolo creates opportunities for a more nuanced and effective exploration of the vast chemical space, opening new frontiers in the development of molecular entities with tailored properties and functionalities.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 03:15:25 UTC (5,177 KB)"

Aizenstein","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Traditional approaches in mental health research apply General Linear Models (GLM) to describe the longitudinal dynamics of observed psycho-behavioral measurements (questionnaire summary scores). Similarly, GLMs are also applied to characterize relationships between neurobiological measurements (regional fMRI signals) and perceptual stimuli or other regional signals. While these methods are useful for exploring linear correlations among the isolated signals of those constructs (i.e., summary scores or fMRI signals), these classical frameworks fall short in providing insights into the comprehensive system-level dynamics underlying observable changes. Hidden Markov Models (HMM) are a statistical model that enable us to describe the sequential relations among multiple observable constructs, and when applied through the lens of Finite State Automata (FSA), can provide a more integrated and intuitive framework for modeling and understanding the underlying controller (the prescription for how to respond to inputs) that fundamentally defines any system, as opposed to linearly correlating output signals produced by the controller. We present a simple and intuitive HMM processing pipeline vcHMM (See Preliminary Data) that highlights FSA theory and is applicable for both behavioral analysis of questionnaire data and fMRI data. HMMs offer theoretic promise as they are computationally equivalent to the FSA, the control processor of a Turing Machine (TM) The dynamic programming Viterbi algorithm is used to leverage the HMM model. It efficiently identifies the most likely sequence of hidden states. The vcHMM pipeline leverages this grammar to understand how behavior and neural activity relate to depression.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 02:46:17 UTC (1,066 KB)"

Using insights from biology and astrophysics, we studied the habitability of M-dwarf exoplanets by modeling their surface temperature and flare UV and X-ray doses using the Martian atmosphere as a shielding model. Analyzing the Proxima Centauri and TRAPPIST-1 systems, our models suggest that Proxima b and TRAPPIST-1 e are likeliest to have temperatures compatible with surface liquid water, as well as tolerable radiation environments. Results of the modeling were used as a basis for microbiology experiments to assess spore survival of the melanin-rich fungus Aspergillus niger to exoplanet-like radiation (UV-C and X-rays). Results showed that A. niger spores can endure superflare events on M-dwarf planets when shielded by a Mars-like atmosphere or by a thin layer of soil or water. Melanin-deficient spores suspended in a melanin-rich solution showed higher survival rates and germination efficiency when compared to melanin-free solutions. Overall, the models developed in this work establish a framework for microbiological research in habitability studies. Finally, we showed that A. niger spores can survive harsh radiation conditions of simulated exoplanets, also emphasizing the importance of multifunctional molecules like melanins in radiation shielding beyond Earth.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 01:58:12 UTC (13,918 KB)"

Coherent light sources, such as the X-ray free electron laser (XFEL), enable remarkable discoveries in cell biology, protein crystallography, chemistry or materials science. However, in contrast to optical lasers, lack of X-ray mirrors demands XFELs to amplify radiation over a single pass, requiring tens or hundreds of meters long undulators to produce bright femtosecond X-ray pulses. Here, we propose a new ultrafast coherent light source based on laser reflection from a relativistic mirror driven by a relativistic charged particle beam in micrometer-scale plasma. We show that reflection of millijoule-level laser pulses from such mirrors can produce bright, coherent and bandwidth-tunable attosecond X-ray pulses with peak intensity and spectral brightness comparable to XFELs. In addition, we find that beam-driven relativistic mirrors are highly robust, with laser-induced damage threshold exceeding solid-state components by at least two orders of magnitude. Our results promise a new way for bright coherent attosecond X-ray pulse generation, suitable for unique applications in fundamental physics, biology and chemistry.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 19:18:00 UTC (8,626 KB)"

However, modeling genomic sequences introduces challenges such as the need to model long-range token interactions, the effects of upstream and downstream regions of the genome, and the reverse complementarity (RC) of DNA. Here, we propose an architecture motivated by these challenges that builds off the long-range Mamba block, and extends it to a BiMamba component that supports bi-directionality, and to a MambaDNA block that additionally supports RC equivariance. We use MambaDNA as the basis of Caduceus, the first family of RC equivariant bi-directional long-range DNA language models, and we introduce pre-training and fine-tuning strategies that yield Caduceus DNA foundation models. Caduceus outperforms previous long-range models on downstream benchmarks; on a challenging long-range variant effect prediction task, Caduceus exceeds the performance of 10x larger models that do not leverage bi-directionality or equivariance.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 01:42:51 UTC (1,838 KB)"

To boost the clinical deployment of ensemble regression methods that quantify RV volumes using tabular data from the widely available two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE), we propose to complement the volume predictions with uncertainty scores. To this end, we employ an instance-based method which uses the learned tree structure to identify the nearest training samples to a target instance and then uses a number of distribution types to more flexibly model the output. The probabilistic and point-prediction performances of the proposed framework are evaluated on a relatively small-scale dataset, comprising 100 end-diastolic and end-systolic RV volumes. The reference values for point performance were obtained from MRI. The results demonstrate that our flexible approach yields improved probabilistic and point performances over other state-of-the-art methods. The appropriateness of the proposed framework is showcased by providing exemplar cases. The estimated uncertainty embodies both aleatoric and epistemic types. This work aligns with trustworthy artificial intelligence since it can be used to enhance the decision-making process and reduce risks. The feature importance scores of our framework can be exploited to reduce the number of required 2DE views which could enhance the proposed pipeline's clinical application.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 12:36:31 UTC (1,481 KB)"

Despite its importance, complexity is poorly understood and ironically, previous models of image complexity have been quite \textit{complex}. There have been many attempts to find handcrafted features that explain complexity, but these features are usually dataset specific, and hence fail to generalise. On the other hand, more recent work has employed deep neural networks to predict complexity, but these models remain difficult to interpret, and do not guide a theoretical understanding of the problem. Here we propose to model complexity using segment-based representations of images. We use state-of-the-art segmentation models, SAM and FC-CLIP, to quantify the number of segments at multiple granularities, and the number of classes in an image respectively. We find that complexity is well-explained by a simple linear model with these two features across six diverse image-sets of naturalistic scene and art images.

This dual-strategy approach utilizes path topology to transform protein-ligand complexes into topological sequences, enabling the use of advanced large language models for analyzing protein-ligand interactions and enhancing its reliability with factual insights garnered from historical data. It has shown unparalleled performance in predicting binding affinity tasks across various benchmarks, including specific evaluations related to SARS-CoV-2, and assesses the impact of virus mutations on drug efficacy, offering crucial insights into potential drug resistance. The predictions align with observed mutation patterns in SARS-CoV-2, indicating that the widespread use of the Pfizer drug has lead to viral evolution and reduced drug efficacy. PLFormer-PAF's capabilities extend beyond identifying drug-resistant strains, positioning it as a key tool in drug discovery research and the development of new therapeutic strategies against fast-mutating viruses like COVID-19.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 02:35:47 UTC (40,404 KB)"

There is limited research comparing the renal safety of entecavir and tenofovir when used with pegylated interferon. This study will compare changes in renal function in chronic hepatitis B patients treated with pegylated interferon and either entecavir or tenofovir. The study included a cohort of 836 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) who received treatment with pegylated interferon (IFN) either alone or in combination with entecavir (ETV) and tenofovir (TDF) between the years 2018 and 2021. Of these patients, 713 were included in a matched analysis comparing outcomes between those who were cured and those who were uncured, while 123 patients received IFN alone as a control group for comparison with the ETV and TDF treatment groups. The primary outcome measured was the change in renal function, specifically estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), cystatin C (CysC), and inorganic phosphorus (IPHOS). Patients were categorized into stage 1 or stage 2 based on a baseline eGFR of less than 90 ml/min/m^2 Results: 125 CHB patients were matched 1:1 in both the combined treatment and cured groups. Baseline eGFR, CysC, and IPHOS levels were similar between the groups. Renal function in stage 1 and stage 2 groups showed a decreasing trend at 48 weeks after an initial increase.Correlation analysis showed significant relationships between changes in ALT and eGFR values at 12 weeks in both non-cured and cured groups. Conclusions: Over the 48-week duration of combined treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), it was found that both Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF) and Entecavir (ETV) did not lead to an increase in renal injury.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 06:10:14 UTC (1,455 KB)"

We introduce a framework using dimensionless numbers to delineate transitions from dripping to jetting and elucidate the governing forces. Highlighting the understudied area of complex fluid ejections, this work not only rationalizes the biophysics involved but also uncovers potential engineering applications in soft robotics, additive manufacturing, and drug delivery.

Schraiber, Tamara Broderick","Methodology (stat.ME)","Collecting genomics data across multiple heterogeneous populations (e.g., across different cancer types) has the potential to improve our understanding of disease. Despite sequencing advances, though, resources often remain a constraint when gathering data. So it would be useful for experimental design if experimenters with access to a pilot study could predict the number of new variants they might expect to find in a follow-up study: both the number of new variants shared between the populations and the total across the populations. While many authors have developed prediction methods for the single-population case, we show that these predictions can fare poorly across multiple populations that are heterogeneous. We prove that, surprisingly, a natural extension of a state-of-the-art single-population predictor to multiple populations fails for fundamental reasons. We provide the first predictor for the number of new shared variants and new total variants that can handle heterogeneity in multiple populations. We show that our proposed method works well empirically using real cancer and population genetics data.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 16:03:21 UTC (9,958 KB)"

Carson, Alexander Leemans","Quantitative Methods (q-bio.QM)","Tractography algorithms are used extensively to delineate white matter structures, by operating on the voxel-wise information generated through the application of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) or other models to diffusion weighted (DW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. We demonstrate that these methods commonly yield systematic streamline length dependent distortions of tractography derived tissue microstructure parameters, such as fractional anisotropy (FA). This dependency may be described as piecewise linear. For streamlines shorter than an inflection point (determined for a group of tracts delineated for each individual brain), estimates of tissue microstructure exhibit a positive linear relation with streamline length. For streamlines longer than the point of inflection, the association is weaker, with the slope of the relationship between streamline length and tissue microstructure differing only marginally from zero. As the dependency is most pronounced for a range of streamline lengths encountered typically in DW imaging of the human brain (less than ~100 mm), our results suggest that some previous estimates of tissue microstructure should be treated with considerable caution. A method is described, whereby an Akaike information weighted average of linear, Blackman and piecewise linear model predictions, may be used to compensate effectively for the dependence of FA (and other estimates of tissue microstructure) on streamline length, across the entire range of streamline lengths present in each specimen.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 14:58:31 UTC (2,409 KB)"

Despite much research done in this area, challenges remain in our better understanding of the behaviour of the cell in response to external stimuli, including the arrangement, quantity, and shape of organelles within the cell. This study explores the electromechanical behaviour of biological cells, including organelles like microtubules, mitochondria, nuclei, and cell membranes. Two distinct cell structures have been developed to explore the cell responses to mechanical displacement, resembling actual cell shapes. The finite element method has been utilized to integrate the linear piezoelectric and non-local flexoelectric effects accurately. It is found that the longitudinal stress is absent and only the transverse stress plays a crucial role when the mechanical load is imposed on the top side of the cell through compressive displacement. The impact of flexoelectricity is elucidated by introducing a new parameter called the maximum electric potential ratio ($V_{\text{R,max}}$). It has been found that $V_{\text{R,max}}$ depends upon the orientation angle and shape of the microtubules. Further, the study reveals that the number of microtubules significantly impacts effective elastic and piezoelectric coefficients, affecting cell behaviour based on structure, microtubule orientation, and mechanical stress direction. The insight obtained from the current study can assist in advancements in medical therapies such as tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 13:52:14 UTC (10,287 KB)"

This paper introduces two gene selection strategies for deep learning-based survival prediction models. The first strategy uses a sparsity-inducing method while the second one uses importance based gene selection for identifying relevant genes. Our overall approach leverages the power of deep learning to model complex biological data structures, while sparsity-inducing methods ensure the selection process focuses on the most informative genes, minimizing noise and redundancy. Through comprehensive experimentation on diverse genomic and survival datasets, we demonstrate that our strategy not only identifies gene signatures with high predictive power for survival outcomes but can also streamlines the process for low-cost genomic profiling. The implications of this research are profound as it offers a scalable and effective tool for advancing personalized medicine and targeted cancer therapies. By pushing the boundaries of gene selection methodologies, our work contributes significantly to the ongoing efforts in cancer genomics, promising improved diagnostic and prognostic capabilities in clinical settings.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 10:44:57 UTC (917 KB)"

The aim of this study was to evaluate the timing of fluorescence as a reproducible parameter and its efficacy in predicting anastomotic leakage (AL) in colorectal surgery. Methods: A consecutive cohort of 108 patients undergoing minimally invasive elective procedures for colorectal cancer was prospectively enrolled. The difference between macro and microperfusion DeltaT was obtained by calculating the timing of fluorescence at the level of iliac artery division and colonic wall, respectively. Results: Subjects with a DeltaT higher 15.5 s had a higher tendency to develop an AL (p lower 0.01). The DeltaT/heart rate interaction was found to predict AL with an odds ratio of 1.02 (p lower 0.01); a cut-off threshold of 832 was identified (sensitivity 0.86, specificity 0.77). Perfusion parameters were also associated with a faster bowel motility resumption and a reduced length of hospital stay. Conclusions: The analysis of the timing of fluorescence provides a quantitative, easy evaluation of tissue perfusion. A DeltaT/HR interaction higher 832 may be used as a real-time parameter to guide surgical decision making in colorectal surgery.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 08:51:01 UTC (795 KB)"

Its attribute of fitting may result in a lack of an underlying physical picture, yet the fitting parameters can provide information about biochemical reactions, such as the number of transcription factors (TFs) and the binding energy between regulatory elements. However, it remains unclear when and how much biochemical information can Hill function provide in addition to fitting. Here, started from the interactions between TFs and RNA polymerase during transcription regulation and both of their association-dissociation reactions at specific/nonspecific sites on DNA, the regulatory effect of TFs was deduced as fold change. We found that, for weak promoter, fold change can degrade into the regulatory factor (Freg) which is closely correlated with Hill function. By directly comparing and fitting with Hill function, the fitting parameters and corresponding biochemical reaction parameters in Freg were analyzed and discussed, where the single TF and multiple TFs that with cooperativity and basic logic effects were considered. We concluded the strength of promoter and interactions between TFs determine whether Hill function can reflect the corresponding biochemical information. Our findings highlight the role of Hill function in modeling/fitting for transcriptional regulation, which also benefits the preparation of synthetic regulatory elements.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 03:32:56 UTC (1,170 KB)"

However, methods for doing this can be computationally expensive, particularly when the number of unknown model parameters is large. The aim of this study is to develop and test an efficient profile likelihood-based method, which takes advantage of the structure of the mathematical model being used. We do this by identifying specific parameters that affect model output in a known way, such as a linear scaling. We illustrate the method by applying it to three caricature models from different areas of the life sciences: (i) a predator-prey model from ecology; (ii) a compartment-based epidemic model from health sciences; and, (iii) an advection-diffusion-reaction model describing transport of dissolved solutes from environmental science. We show that the new method produces results of comparable accuracy to existing profile likelihood methods, but with substantially fewer evaluations of the forward model. We conclude that our method could provide a much more efficient approach to parameter inference for models where a structure approach is feasible.

Starting with the classic Fisher-Kolmogorov (Fisher-KPP) model, we illustrate how computational methods can be used to explore time-dependent partial differential equation (PDE) solutions in parallel with phase plane and regular perturbation techniques to explore invading travelling wave solutions moving with dimensionless speed $c \ge 2$. To overcome the lack of a well-defined sharp front in solutions of the Fisher-KPP model, we also review two alternative modeling approaches. The first is the Porous-Fisher model where the linear diffusion term is replaced with a degenerate nonlinear diffusion term. Using phase plane and regular perturbation methods, we explore the distinction between sharp- and smooth-fronted invading travelling waves that move with dimensionless speed $c \ge 1/\sqrt{2}$. The second alternative approach is to reformulate the Fisher-KPP model as a moving boundary problem on $0 < x < L(t)$, leading to the Fisher-Stefan model with sharp-fronted travelling wave solutions arising from a PDE model with a linear diffusion term. Time-dependent PDE solutions and phase plane methods show that travelling wave solutions of the Fisher-Stefan model can describe both biological invasion $(c > 0)$ and biological recession $(c < 0)$.

Georgiou","Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)","Schrödinger bridges have emerged as an enabling framework for unveiling the stochastic dynamics of systems based on marginal observations at different points in time. The terminology ""bridge'' refers to a probability law that suitably interpolates such marginals. The theory plays a pivotal role in a variety of contemporary developments in machine learning, stochastic control, thermodynamics, and biology, to name a few, impacting disciplines such as single-cell genomics, meteorology, and robotics. In this work, we extend Schrödinger's paradigm of bridges to account for integral constraints along paths, in a way akin to Maximum Caliber - a Maximum Entropy principle applied in a dynamic context. The Maximum Caliber principle has proven useful to infer the dynamics of complex systems e.g., that model gene circuits and protein folding. We unify these two problems via a maximum likelihood formulation to reconcile stochastic dynamics with ensemble-path data. A variety of data types can be encompassed, ranging from distribution moments to average currents along paths. The framework enables inference of time-varying potential landscapes that drive the process. The resulting forces can be interpreted as the optimal control that drives the system in a way that abides by specified integral constraints. Analogous results are presented in a discrete-time, discrete-space setting and specialized to steady-state dynamics. We finish by illustrating the practical applicability of the framework through paradigmatic examples, such as that of bit erasure or protein folding. In doing so, we highlight the strengths of the proposed framework, namely, the generality of the theory, the ease of computation, and the ability to interpret results in terms of system dynamics. This is in contrast to Maximum-Caliber problems where the focus is typically on updating a probability law on paths.","Sun, 3 Mar 2024 01:11:50 UTC (1,047 KB)"

However, tree reconstruction criteria like maximum parsimony do not necessarily lead to unique trees and in some cases even fail to recognize the \enquote{correct} tree (i.e., the tree on which the data was generated). On the other hand, a recent study has shown that for an alignment containing precisely those characters (sites) which require up to two substitutions on a given tree, this tree will be the unique maximum parsimony tree. It is the aim of the present manuscript to generalize this recent result in the following sense: We show that for a tree with $n$ leaves, as long as $k< \frac{n}{8}+\frac{6}{5}-\frac{1}{10} \sqrt{\frac{5}{16} n^2+4}$ (or, equivalently, $n>8 k-\frac{46}{5}+\frac{2}{5} \sqrt{40 k-31} $), the maximum parsimony tree for the alignment containing all characters which require (up to or precisely) $k$ substitutions on a given tree $T$ will be unique in the NNI neighborhood of $T$ and it will coincide with $T$, too. In other words, within the NNI neighborhood of $T$, $T$ is the unique most parsimonious tree for said alignment.

Within our framework, all ecological variables are embedded into four distinct vector spaces and ecological interactions are represented by geometric transformations between these spaces. We show that near a steady state, such geometric transformations directly map environmental perturbations -- in resource availability and mortality rates -- to shifts in niche structure.

Kim, Nicolas Perrin-Gilbert, Erkan Narmanli, Paul Klein, Christopher R. Myers, Itai Cohen, Joshua J. Waterfall, James P. Sethna","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Natural systems with emergent behaviors often organize along low-dimensional subsets of high-dimensional spaces. For example, despite the tens of thousands of genes in the human genome, the principled study of genomics is fruitful because biological processes rely on coordinated organization that results in lower dimensional phenotypes. To uncover this organization, many nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques have successfully embedded high-dimensional data into low-dimensional spaces by preserving local similarities between data points. However, the nonlinearities in these methods allow for too much curvature to preserve general trends across multiple non-neighboring data clusters, thereby limiting their interpretability and generalizability to out-of-distribution data. Here, we address both of these limitations by regularizing the curvature of manifolds generated by variational autoencoders, a process we coin ``$\Gamma$-VAE''. We demonstrate its utility using two example data sets: bulk RNA-seq from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx); and single cell RNA-seq from a lineage tracing experiment in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation. We find that the resulting regularized manifolds identify mesoscale structure associated with different cancer cell types, and accurately re-embed tissues from completely unseen, out-of distribution cancers as if they were originally trained on them. Finally, we show that preserving long-range relationships to differentiated cells separates undifferentiated cells -- which have not yet specialized -- according to their eventual fate. Broadly, we anticipate that regularizing the curvature of generative models will enable more consistent, predictive, and generalizable models in any high-dimensional system with emergent low-dimensional behavior.","Sat, 2 Mar 2024 03:26:09 UTC (15,801 KB)"
"98","An internal sensory model allows for balance control based on non-actionable proprioceptive feedback","Eric Maris","Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC)","All motor tasks with a mechanical system (a human body, a rider on a bicycle) that is approximately linear in the part of the state space where it stays most of the time (e.g., upright balance control) have the following property: actionable sensory feedback allows for optimal control actions that are a simple linear combination of the sensory feedback. When only non-actionable sensory feedback is available, optimal control for these approximately linear mechanical systems is based on an internal dynamical system that estimates the states, and that can be implemented as a recurrent neural network (RNN). It uses a sensory model to update the state estimates with the non-actionable sensory feedback, and the weights of this RNN are fully specified by results from optimal feedback control. This is highly relevant for muscle spindle afferent firing rates which, under perfectly coordinated fusimotor and skeletomotor control, scale with the exafferent joint acceleration component. The resulting control mechanism balances a standing body and a rider-bicycle combination using realistic parameter values and with forcing torques that are feasible for humans.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 19:58:22 UTC (976 KB)[v2] Tue, 5 Mar 2024 16:58:19 UTC (933 KB)"
"99","History-dependence shapes causal inference of brain-behaviour relationships","Brandon Caie, Gunnar Blohm","Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC)","Behavioural and neural time series are often correlated with the past. This history-dependence may represent a fundamental property of the measured variables, or may arise from how confounding variables change over time. Here we argue that undecidability about the ground-truth of history-dependence is a general computational property of systems that exchange information with its environment, and show that the resulting uncertainty has a direct impact on causal inference. We first argue that uncertainty in the ground truth of history-dependence is an inherent property of open systems that cannot be explicitly falsified. Simple model systems are then simulated to show how different assumptions about history-dependence can lead to spurious correlations and statistical properties of data distributions that are typically unaccounted for. We then consider this problem from an interventionist perspective, showing that interventions can only be guaranteed to remedy the spurious correlation problem when the latent dynamics between the intervention and measured processes are known a priori, and the effect of the intervention is invariant at the chosen level of analysis. We conclude that uncertainty about history-dependence is a fundamental property of the study of neural systems, and in light of this discuss how causality should be assessed in neuroscience.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 19:54:50 UTC (3,644 KB)"

Bora","Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)","Undetected infectious populations have played a major role in the COVID-19 outbreak across the globe and estimation of this undetected class is a major concern in understanding the actual size of the COVID-19 infections. Due to the asymptomatic nature of some infections, many cases have gone undetected. Also, despite carrying COVID-19 symptoms, most of the infected population kept the infections hidden and stayed unreported, especially in a country like India. Based on these factors, we have added an undetected compartment to the already developed SEIR model [48] to estimate these uncounted infections. In this article, we have applied Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) to estimate the undetected infectious populations in the 20 worst-affected Indian states as well as India as a whole. The analysis has been carried out for the first as well as second surge of COVID-19 infections in India. A ratio of the active undetected infectious to the active detected infectious population is calculated through the PINN analysis which gives a picture of the real size of the pandemic in India. The rate at which symptomatic infectious population goes undetected and are never reported is also estimated using the PINN method. Toward the end, an artificial neural network (ANN) based forecasting scenario of the pandemic in India is presented. The prediction is found to be reliable as the training of the neural network has been carried out using the unique features, obtained from the state-wide analysis of the newly proposed model as well as from the PINN analysis.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 18:17:15 UTC (694 KB)"

Furthermore, we propose two novel semantic-level protein augmentation methods, namely Integrated Gradients Substitution and Back Translation Substitution, which enable protein semantic-aware augmentation through saliency detection and biological knowledge. Finally, we integrate extended and proposed augmentations into an augmentation pool and propose a simple but effective framework, namely Automated Protein Augmentation (APA), which can adaptively select the most suitable augmentation combinations for different tasks. Extensive experiments have shown that APA enhances the performance of five protein related tasks by an average of 10.55% across three architectures compared to vanilla implementations without augmentation, highlighting its potential to make a great impact on the field.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 07:58:29 UTC (1,037 KB)"

Aldo Faisal","Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC)","Dysarthria, a condition resulting from impaired control of the speech muscles due to neurological disorders, significantly impacts the communication and quality of life of patients. The condition's complexity, human scoring and varied presentations make its assessment and management challenging. This study presents a transformer-based framework for automatically assessing dysarthria severity from raw speech data. It can offer an objective, repeatable, accessible, standardised and cost-effective and compared to traditional methods requiring human expert assessors. We develop a transformer framework, called Speaker-Agnostic Latent Regularisation (SALR), incorporating a multi-task learning objective and contrastive learning for speaker-independent multi-class dysarthria severity classification. The multi-task framework is designed to reduce reliance on speaker-specific characteristics and address the intrinsic intra-class variability of dysarthric speech. We evaluated on the Universal Access Speech dataset using leave-one-speaker-out cross-validation, our model demonstrated superior performance over traditional machine learning approaches, with an accuracy of $70.48\%$ and an F1 score of $59.23\%$. Our SALR model also exceeded the previous benchmark for AI-based classification, which used support vector machines, by $16.58\%$. We open the black box of our model by visualising the latent space where we can observe how the model substantially reduces speaker-specific cues and amplifies task-specific ones, thereby showing its robustness. In conclusion, SALR establishes a new benchmark in speaker-independent multi-class dysarthria severity classification using generative AI.

Silva","Quantitative Methods (q-bio.QM)","Background: In recent years, researchers have made significant strides in understanding the heterogeneity of breast cancer and its various subtypes. However, the wealth of genomic and proteomic data available today necessitates efficient frameworks, instruments, and computational tools for meaningful analysis. Despite its success as a prognostic tool, the PAM50 gene signature's reliance on many genes presents challenges in terms of cost and complexity. Consequently, there is a need for more efficient methods to classify breast cancer subtypes using a reduced gene set accurately. Results: This study explores the potential of achieving precise breast cancer subtype categorization using a reduced gene set derived from the PAM50 gene signature. By employing a ""Few-Shot Genes Selection"" method, we randomly select smaller subsets from PAM50 and evaluate their performance using metrics and a linear model, specifically the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. In addition, we aim to assess whether a more compact gene set can maintain performance while simplifying the classification process. Our findings demonstrate that certain reduced gene subsets can perform comparable or superior to the full PAM50 gene signature. Conclusions: The identified gene subsets, with 36 genes, have the potential to contribute to the development of more cost-effective and streamlined diagnostic tools in breast cancer research and clinical settings.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 18:04:54 UTC (2,596 KB)"

It is assumed that molecules of essentially different sizes dissolved in fluid and are transported through pores of different sizes. The stress tensor, the main force leading to the material deformation, is taken not only in the standard linear form but also with an additional nonlinear part. The model is constructed in 1D space and consists of six nonlinear equations. It is shown that the governing equations are integrable in stationary case, therefore all steady-state solutions are constructed. The obtained solutions are used in an example for healthy and tumour tissue, in particular, tissue displacements are calculated and compared for parameters taken from experimental data in cases of the linear and nonlinear stress tensors. Since the governing equations are non-integrable in non-stationary case, the Lie symmetry analysis is used in order to construct time-dependent exact solutions. Depending on parameters arising in the governing equations, several special cases with non-trivial Lie symmetries are identified. As a result, multi-parameter families of exact solutions are constructed including those in terms of special functions(hypergeometric and Bessel functions). A possible application of the solutions obtained is demonstrated.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 01:23:56 UTC (1,425 KB)"

Gartner, Erwin Frey","Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)","Self-assembly is a fundamental concept in biology and of significant interest to nanotechnology. Significant progress has been made in characterizing and controlling the properties of the resulting structures, both experimentally and theoretically. However, much less is known about kinetic constraints and determinants of dynamical properties like time efficiency, although these constraints can become severe limiting factors of self-assembly processes. Here we investigate how the time efficiency and other dynamical properties of reversible self-assembly depend on the morphology (shape) of the building blocks for systems in which the binding energy between the constituents is large. As paradigmatic examples, we stochastically simulate the self-assembly of constituents with triangular, square, and hexagonal morphology into two-dimensional structures of a specified size. We find that the constituents' morphology critically determines the assembly time and how it scales with the size of the target structure. Our analysis reveals three key structural parameters defined by the morphology: The nucleation size and attachment order, which describe the effective order of the chemical reactions by which clusters nucleate and grow, respectively, and the growth exponent, which determines how the growth rate of an emerging structure scales with its size. Using this characterization, we formulate an effective theory of the self-assembly kinetics, which we show exhibits an inherent scale invariance. This allows us to identify general scaling laws that describe the minimal assembly time as a function of the size of the target structure. We show how these insights on the kinetics of self-assembly processes can be used to design assembly schemes that could significantly increase the time efficiency and robustness of artificial self-assembly processes.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 01:22:29 UTC (7,099 KB)[v2] Mon, 4 Mar 2024 23:43:57 UTC (7,111 KB)"

Batista, Jürgen Kurths","Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph)","Spiral waves are spatial-temporal patterns that can emerge in different systems as heart tissues, chemical oscillators, ecological networks and the brain. These waves have been identified in the neocortex of turtles, rats, and humans, particularly during sleep-like states. Although their functions in cognitive activities remain until now poorly understood, these patterns are related to cortical activity modulation and contribute to cortical processing. In this work, we construct a neuronal network layer based on the spatial distribution of pyramidal neurons. Our main goal is to investigate how local connectivity and coupling strength are associated with the emergence of spiral waves. Therefore, we propose a trustworthy method capable of detecting different wave patterns, based on local and global phase order parameters. As a result, we find that the range of connection radius (R) plays a crucial role in the appearance of spiral waves. For R < 20 {\mu}m, only asynchronous activity is observed due to small number of connections. The coupling strength (gsyn ) greatly influences the pattern transitions for higher R, where spikes and bursts firing patterns can be observed in spiral and non-spiral waves. Finally, we show that for some values of R and gsyn bistable states of wave patterns are obtained.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 12:25:47 UTC (4,052 KB)"

This research investigated the impact of elevated temperature and humidity (25 60%RH, 30 70%RH, 35 80%RH, 40 90%RH) on the cognitive functions and performance of operators. Meanwhile, we explored the psychological-physiological mechanism underlying the change in performance by electrocardiogram (ECG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), and eye tracking physiologically. Psychological aspects such as situation awareness, workload, and working memory were assessed. Eventually, we verified and extended the maximal adaptability model to the extreme condition. Unexpectedly, a temporary improvement in simple reaction tasks but rapid impairment in advanced cognitive functions (i.e. situation awareness, communication, working memory) was obtained above 35 WBGT. The best performance in a suitable environment was due to more effective activation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). With temperature increasing, more mistakes occurred and comprehension was impaired due to drowsiness and lower arousal levels, according to evidence of compensatory effect in fNIRS. In the extreme environment, the enhanced PFC cooperation with higher functional connectivity resulted in a temporary improvement, while depressed activation in PFC, heavy physical load, and poor regulation of the cardiovascular system restricted it. Our results provide a detailed study of the process of operators' performance and cognitive functions when encountering increasing heat stress, as well as its underlying mechanisms from a neuroergonomics perspective. This can contribute to a better understanding of the interaction between operators' performance and workplace conditions, and help to achieve a more reliable human-centered production system in the promising era of Industry 5.0.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 07:07:39 UTC (20,536 KB)"

"123","Metabolic scaling in small life forms","Mark E. Ritchie, Christopher P. Kempes","Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph)","Metabolic scaling is one of the most important patterns in biology. Theory explaining the 3/4-power size-scaling of biological metabolic rate does not predict the non-linear scaling observed for smaller life forms. Here we present a new model for cells $<10^{-8}$ m$^{3}$ that maximizes power from the reaction-displacement dynamics of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Maximum metabolic rate is achieved through an allocation of cell volume to optimize a ratio of reaction velocity to molecular movement. Small cells $< 10^{-17}$ m$^{3}$ generate power under diffusion by diluting enzyme concentration as cell volume increases. Larger cells require bulk flow of cytoplasm generated by molecular motors. These outcomes predict curves with literature-reported parameters that match the observed scaling of metabolic rates for unicells, and predicts the volume at which Prokaryotes transition to Eukaryotes. We thus reveal multiple size-dependent physical constraints for microbes in a model that extends prior work to provide a parsimonious hypothesis for how metabolism scales across small life.","Sat, 16 Dec 2023 04:45:07 UTC (2,314 KB)"

Fendley, Sriram Srikant, Boris Shraiman","Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)","Phages and their bacterial hosts are locked in an evolutionary competition which in small and closed systems typically results in the extinction of one or the other. To resist phages bacteria have evolved numerous defense systems, which nevertheless are still overcome by specific phage counter-defense mechanisms. These defense/counter-defense systems are a major element of microbial genetic diversity and have been demonstrated to propagate between strains by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). It has been proposed that the totality of defense systems found in microbial communities collectively form a distributed ""pan-immune"" system with individual elements moving between strains via ubiquitous HGT. Here, we formulate a Lotka-Volterra type model of a host/phage system interacting via a combinatorial variety of defense/counter-defense systems and show that HGT enables stable maintenance of diverse defense/counter-defense genes in the microbial pan-genome even when individual microbial strains inevitably undergo extinction. This stability requires the HGT rate to be sufficiently high to ensure that some descendant of a ""dying"" strain survives thanks to the immunity acquired through HGT from the community at large, thus establishing a new strain. This mechanism of persistence for the pan-immune gene pool is fundamentally similar to the ""island migration"" model of ecological diversity, with genes moving between genomes instead of species migrating between islands.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 17:43:14 UTC (15,166 KB)"

This approach works well if the number of states and their connectivity is known. But for the multi-domain protein Hsp90, a standard HMM analysis with optimization of the BIC (Bayesian information criterion) cannot explain long-lived states well. Therefore, here we employ constrained hidden Markov models, which neglect transitions between states by including assumptions. Gradually tuning a model with justified and focused changes allows us to improve its effectiveness and the score of the BIC. This became possible by analyzing time traces with several thousand observable transitions and, therefore, superb statistics. In this scheme, we also monitor the residences in the states reconstructed by the model, aiming to find exponentially distributed dwell times. We show how introducing new states can achieve these statistics but also point out limitations, e.g., for substantial similarity of two states connected to a common neighbor. One of the states displays the lowest free energy and is likely the idle open `waiting state', in which Hsp90 waits for the binding of nucleotides, cochaperones, or clients.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 14:37:21 UTC (2,622 KB)"

In order to investigate the decision making process in the heterogeneous mixing population regarding whether to be vaccinated or not, we propose the modeling framework which includes the epidemic models and the game theoretical analysis. We consider two sources of heterogeneity in this paper: the different activity levels and the different relative vaccination costs. It is interesting to observe that, if both sources of heterogeneity are considered, there exist a finite number of Nash equilibria (evolutionary stable strategies (ESS)) of the vaccination game. While if only the difference of activity levels is considered, there are infinitely many Nash equilibira. For the latter case, the initial condition of the decision making process becomes highly sensitive. In the application of public health management, the inclusion of population heterogeneity significantly complicates the prediction of the overall vaccine coverage level.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 14:19:59 UTC (42 KB)"

The protein secondary structure is formed by the folding of the protein primary structure, and the protein tertiary structure is formed by the bending and folding of the secondary structure. Therefore, the study of protein secondary structure is very helpful to the overall understanding of protein structure. Although the accuracy of protein secondary structure prediction has continuously improved with the development of machine learning and deep learning, progress in the field of protein structure prediction, unfortunately, remains insufficient to meet the large demand for protein information. Therefore, based on the advantages of deep learning-based methods in feature extraction and learning ability, this paper adopts a two-dimensional fusion deep neural network model, DstruCCN, which uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CCN) and a supervised Transformer protein language model for single-sequence protein structure prediction. The training features of the two are combined to predict the protein Transformer binding site matrix, and then the three-dimensional structure is reconstructed using energy minimization.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 12:24:20 UTC (1,360 KB)[v2] Fri, 8 Mar 2024 05:30:10 UTC (384 KB)"

We analyse a stochastic population model with age-dependent division and death rates and characterise the emergence of fractional killing as a stochastic phenomenon under constant and periodic drug environments. In constant environments, increasing cell cycle noise induces a phase transition from complete to fractional killing, while increasing death noise can induce the reverse transition. In periodic drug environments, we discover survival resonance phenomena that give rise to peaks in the survival probabilities at division or death times that are multiples of the environment duration not seen in unstructured populations.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 11:19:12 UTC (850 KB)"

The reliability of the seDPD method is verified by considering the viscosity, thermal diffusivity, and hydrodynamic drag force on the nanoparticles. Using this method, the transport of nanoparticles driven by the thermophoretic force across the polymer network is simulated. The results show that the nanoparticles exhibit the phenomenon of giant acceleration of diffusion (GAD) in the polymer network, indicating that Brownian particles can exhibit GAD when crossing entropic barriers.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 03:39:11 UTC (967 KB)"

Current artificial intelligence is only seemingly intelligent information processing and does not truly understand or be subjectively aware of oneself and perceive the world with the self as human intelligence does. In this paper, we introduce a Brain-inspired and Self-based Artificial Intelligence (BriSe AI) paradigm. This BriSe AI paradigm is dedicated to coordinating various cognitive functions and learning strategies in a self-organized manner to build human-level AI models and robotic applications. Specifically, BriSe AI emphasizes the crucial role of the Self in shaping the future AI, rooted with a practical hierarchical Self framework, including Perception and Learning, Bodily Self, Autonomous Self, Social Self, and Conceptual Self. The hierarchical framework of the Self highlights self-based environment perception, self-bodily modeling, autonomous interaction with the environment, social interaction and collaboration with others, and even more abstract understanding of the Self. Furthermore, the positive mutual promotion and support among multiple levels of Self, as well as between Self and learning, enhance the BriSe AI's conscious understanding of information and flexible adaptation to complex environments, serving as a driving force propelling BriSe AI towards real Artificial General Intelligence.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 01:15:17 UTC (4,239 KB)"

Here we study the rare cases of networks that defy this expectation, with attractors that require controlling most nodes. We find empirically that unstable fixed points are the primary recurring characteristic of networks that prove more difficult to control. We describe an efficient way to identify unstable fixed points and show that, in both existing biological models and ensembles of random dynamics, we can better explain the variance of control kernel sizes by incorporating the prevalence of unstable fixed points. In the end, the fact that these exceptions are associated with dynamics that are unstable to small perturbations hints that they are likely an artifact of using deterministic models. These exceptions are likely to be biologically irrelevant, supporting the generality of easy controllability in biological networks.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 23:35:47 UTC (3,061 KB)"

It is an important species for regional fisheries, but their transportation and migration patterns during early life stages remain unclear. In this study, we analyzed the stable oxygen isotope ratios of otoliths of young-of-the-year (age 0) Japanese sardines collected from the northern offshore and southern coastal areas of the Sea of Japan in 2015 and 2016. The ontogenetic shifts of the geographic distribution were estimated by comparing the profiles of life-long isotope ratios and temporally varying isoscape, which was calculated using the temperature and salinity fields produced by an ocean data assimilation model. Individuals that were collected in the northern and southern areas hatched and stayed in the southern areas (west offshore of Kyushu) until late June, and thereafter, they can be distinguished into two groups: one that migrated northward at shallow layer and one that stayed around the southern area in the deep layer. A comparison of somatic growth trajectories of the two groups, which was reconstructed based on otolith microstructure analysis, suggested that individuals that migrated northward had significantly larger body lengths in late June than those that stayed in the southern area. These results indicate that young-of-the-year Japanese sardines that hatched in the southern area may have been forced to choose one of two strategies to avoid extremely high water temperatures within seasonal and geographical limits. These include migrating northward or moving to deeper layers.

The population size of these mountain bird tends to decline on the reference sites and shows differences according to changes in local landscape characteristics. Habitat changes are at the centre of the identified pressures impacting part or all of its life cycle, according to experts. Hence, an approach to monitor population dynamics, is trough modelling the favourable habitats of Black Grouse breeding (nesting sites). Then, coupling modelling with multi-source remote sensing data (medium and very high spatial resolution), allowed the implementation of a spatial distribution model of the species. Indeed, the extraction of variables from remote sensing helped to describe the area studied at appropriate spatial and temporal scales: horizontal and vertical structure (heterogeneity), functioning (vegetation indices), phenology (seasonal or inter-annual dynamics) and biodiversity. An annual time series of radiometric indices (NDVI, NDWI, BI {\ldots}) from Sentinel-2 has made it possible to generate Dynamic Habitat Indices (DHIs) to derive phenological indications on the nature and dynamics of natural habitats. In addition, very high resolution images (SPOT6) provided access to the fine structure of natural habitats, i.e. the vertical and horizontal organisation by states identified as elementary (mineral, herbaceous, low and high woody). Indeed, one of the essential limiting factors for brood rearing is the presence of a well-developed herbaceous or ericaceous stratum in the northern Alps and larch forests in the southern region. A deep learning model was used to classify elementary strata. Finally, Biomod2 R platform, using an ensemble approach, was applied to model, the favourable habitat of Black Grouse reproduction.

In BindDM, we adaptively extract subcomplex, the essential part of binding sites responsible for protein-ligand interactions. Then the selected protein-ligand subcomplex is processed with SE(3)-equivariant neural networks, and transmitted back to each atom of the complex for augmenting the target-aware 3D molecule diffusion generation with binding interaction information. We iterate this hierarchical complex-subcomplex process with cross-hierarchy interaction node for adequately fusing global binding context between the complex and its corresponding subcomplex. Empirical studies on the CrossDocked2020 dataset show BindDM can generate molecules with more realistic 3D structures and higher binding affinities towards the protein targets, with up to -5.92 Avg. Vina Score, while maintaining proper molecular properties. Our code is available at this https URL","Mon, 15 Jan 2024 00:34:00 UTC (3,172 KB)"
"145","Diffusion Language Models Are Versatile Protein Learners","Xinyou Wang, Zaixiang Zheng, Fei Ye, Dongyu Xue, Shujian Huang, Quanquan Gu","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","This paper introduces diffusion protein language model (DPLM), a versatile protein language model that demonstrates strong generative and predictive capabilities for protein sequences. We first pre-train scalable DPLMs from evolutionary-scale protein sequences within a generative self-supervised discrete diffusion probabilistic framework, which generalizes language modeling for proteins in a principled way. After pre-training, DPLM exhibits the ability to generate structurally plausible, novel, and diverse protein sequences for unconditional generation. We further demonstrate the proposed diffusion generative pre-training makes DPLM possess a better understanding of proteins, making it a superior representation learner, which can be fine-tuned for various predictive tasks, comparing favorably to ESM2 (Lin et al., 2022). Moreover, DPLM can be tailored for various needs, which showcases its prowess of conditional generation in several ways: (1) conditioning on partial peptide sequences, e.g., generating scaffolds for functional motifs with high success rate; (2) incorporating other modalities as conditioner, e.g., structure-conditioned generation for inverse folding; and (3) steering sequence generation towards desired properties, e.g., satisfying specified secondary structures, through a plug-and-play classifier guidance.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 18:57:56 UTC (24,076 KB)"

Here, the rich potential for insightful, discriminative information of brain activity offered by high temporal resolution is confounded by the inherent noise of the medium and the spurious nature of correlations computed over short temporal windows. We propose a novel methodology to overcome these problems called Filter Average Short-Term (FAST) functional connectivity. First, long-term, stable, functional connectivity is averaged across an entire study cohort for a given pair of Visual Short Term Memory (VSTM) tasks. The resulting average connectivity matrix, containing information on the strongest general connections for the tasks, is used as a filter to analyse the transient high temporal resolution functional connectivity of individual subjects. In simulations, we show that this method accurately discriminates differences in noisy Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) between two conditions where standard connectivity and other comparable methods fail. We then apply this to analyse activity related to visual short-term memory binding deficits in two cohorts of familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Reproducible significant differences were found in the binding task with no significant difference in the shape task in the P300 ERP range. This allows new sensitive measurements of transient functional connectivity, which can be implemented to obtain results of clinical significance.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 17:15:33 UTC (849 KB)"
"147","Deep Confident Steps to New Pockets: Strategies for Docking Generalization","Gabriele Corso, Arthur Deng, Benjamin Fry, Nicholas Polizzi, Regina Barzilay, Tommi Jaakkola","Biomolecules (q-bio.BM)","Accurate blind docking has the potential to lead to new biological breakthroughs, but for this promise to be realized, docking methods must generalize well across the proteome. Existing benchmarks, however, fail to rigorously assess generalizability. Therefore, we develop DockGen, a new benchmark based on the ligand-binding domains of proteins, and we show that existing machine learning-based docking models have very weak generalization abilities. We carefully analyze the scaling laws of ML-based docking and show that, by scaling data and model size, as well as integrating synthetic data strategies, we are able to significantly increase the generalization capacity and set new state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks. Further, we propose Confidence Bootstrapping, a new training paradigm that solely relies on the interaction between diffusion and confidence models and exploits the multi-resolution generation process of diffusion models. We demonstrate that Confidence Bootstrapping significantly improves the ability of ML-based docking methods to dock to unseen protein classes, edging closer to accurate and generalizable blind docking methods.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 15:15:23 UTC (7,627 KB)"
"148","Why Do Animals Need Shaping? A Theory of Task Composition and Curriculum Learning","Jin Hwa Lee, Stefano Sarao Mannelli, Andrew Saxe","Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC)","Diverse studies in systems neuroscience begin with extended periods of training known as 'shaping' procedures. These involve progressively studying component parts of more complex tasks, and can make the difference between learning a task quickly, slowly or not at all. Despite the importance of shaping to the acquisition of complex tasks, there is as yet no theory that can help guide the design of shaping procedures, or more fundamentally, provide insight into its key role in learning. Modern deep reinforcement learning systems might implicitly learn compositional primitives within their multilayer policy networks. Inspired by these models, we propose and analyse a model of deep policy gradient learning of simple compositional reinforcement learning tasks. Using the tools of statistical physics, we solve for exact learning dynamics and characterise different learning strategies including primitives pre-training, in which task primitives are studied individually before learning compositional tasks. We find a complex interplay between task complexity and the efficacy of shaping strategies. Overall, our theory provides an analytical understanding of the benefits of shaping in a class of compositional tasks and a quantitative account of how training protocols can disclose useful task primitives, ultimately yielding faster and more robust learning.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 14:33:09 UTC (2,889 KB)"

Carlson, Peter J. Kahrilas, John E. Pandolfino, Neelesh A. Patankar","Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC)","An understanding how neurological disorders lead to mechanical dysfunction of the esophagus requires knowledge of the neural circuit of the enteric nervous system. Historically, this has been elusive. Here, we present an empirically guided neural circuit for the esophagus. It has a chain of unidirectionally coupled relaxation oscillators, receiving excitatory signals from stretch receptors along the esophagus. The resulting neuromechanical model reveals complex patterns and behaviors that emerge from interacting components in the system. A wide variety of clinically observed normal and abnormal esophageal responses to distension are successfully predicted. Specifically, repetitive antegrade contractions (RACs) are conclusively shown to emerge from the coupled neuromechanical dynamics in response to sustained volumetric distension. Normal RACs are shown to have a robust balance between excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations, and the mechanical input through stretch receptors. When this balance is affected, contraction patterns akin to motility disorders are observed. For example, clinically observed repetitive retrograde contractions emerge due to a hyper stretch sensitive wall. Such neuromechanical insights could be crucial to eventually develop targeted pharmacological interventions.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 06:49:20 UTC (5,612 KB)[v2] Fri, 1 Mar 2024 18:58:46 UTC (5,612 KB)"
